                "Total GHG emissions for a given asset class largely depend on the carbon efficiency of individual companies within that class for example, the decrease in emissions from the domestic corporate bond portfolio observed in FY 2017 resulted from both a decrease in the amount invested as well as a decrease in GHG emissions from the energy companies within that asset class.",
                "On the other hand, the divergence in emission trends between the foreign equity and foreign corporate bond portfolios in FY 2018 was due to the fact that exposure to companies in the equity portfolio that had a high contribution to total emissions and the emissions from these companies themselves both increased, while the amount invested in highly emitting companies within the bond portfolio and these emissions themselves both decreased.",

                "**Meeting the 2C target by 2023 **will require continuous reductions of portfolio GHG emissions collectively, and considering current individual company GHG emission targets, achieving the portfolio target will be difficult.",

                "**Strategy, Metrics& Targets While initially focused on Scope 1 emissions, Carbon Delta MSCI **brought significant updates to its methodology in 2020: for transition risks assessment, both self- reported and estimated emissions data are combined and considered; Scope 2 and Scope 3 emissions have been added in the calculation of carbon intensities; for the assessment of green opportunities, future green revenues reflected by patents developments have been combined with current green revenues, thus considering current exposure of companies revenues to green activities not just future revenues; the Warming Potential cap which was previously set at 6C has been increased to 10C to capture a broader range of behavior and impacts; carbon emissions reduction targets are now included in the temperature calculation.",
