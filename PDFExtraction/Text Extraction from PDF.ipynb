      "Here are the main determinants of a flight’s carbon footprint:\n",

      "Distance of flight\n",
      "The takeoff and climb phases of a \n",
      "flight burn more fuel than the cruising \n",
      "or landing phases, which makes \n",

      "than long-haul flights.\n",
      "\n",
      "Number of passengers\n",
      "While the number of seats on a plane determines the \n",
      "maximum passenger capacity, any given flight may \n",

      "Operational Efficiency in the Air and on the Ground\n",
      "Alongside fleet renewal efforts, we are investing in new technology \n",
      "to help our aircraft operate more efficiently. For example, in 2020 we \n",
      "began deploying specialized software that uses real-time weather \n",
      "conditions to provide our flight crews with better data about optimal \n",
      "\n",
      "flight altitudes and speeds. This can save fuel and reduce emissions, \n",
      "particularly on long-haul flights. By mid-2020, we were using this \n",
      "technology on 85% of our mainline aircraft. \n",
      "\n",
      "We are also reducing jet fuel consumption pre- and post-flight. This \n",
      "on-the-ground fuel use represents approximately 6% of our total jet fuel \n",
      "consumption. For example, we are reducing the use of onboard auxiliary \n",
      "power units (APUs) during flight preparation by connecting to ground \n",
      "power at the airport terminal, rather than relying on jet fuel to heat or \n",
      "cool the aircraft, operate onboard lighting and run other functions while \n",
      "the aircraft is parked at the gate. This simple change in operational \n",
      "behavior provides a substantial opportunity to decrease both costs and \n",
      "emissions, since electric power is less carbon intensive. We estimate \n",

      "flight, an aircraft can save 1,000 gallons or more of jet fuel annually. \n",
      "\n",
      "Other changes include increasing our use of single-engine taxi \n",
      "operation (i.e., using just one aircraft engine to taxi to the gate after \n",

      "\n",
      "To support these goals, we joined with union leaders and other \n",

      "support to stabilize the passenger airline industry and protect its \n",
      "outstanding workforce. In March, Congress and the Administration \n",
      "responded with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security \n",
      "(CARES) Act, an economic stabilization package to help U.S. workers \n",
      "and businesses devastated by the drastic economic downturn. The \n",
      "Payroll Support Program (PSP) of the CARES Act allowed us to keep \n",
      "our frontline workforce in place through the first phase of the crisis, \n",
      "providing us with approximately $5.8 billion to be used exclusively \n",
      "for the continued payment of team member wages, salaries and \n",

      "early out programs. Across our mainline and wholly owned regional \n",
      "carriers, more than 12,500 of our colleagues have made the difficult \n",
      "decision to leave the company permanently through early out \n",
      "programs or retirement. Another 11,000 team members have offered \n",
      "\n",
      "to take leaves of absence. We have also reduced our management \n",

      "on September 30. But the virus has outlasted our assumptions about \n",
      "when demand for air travel would return. Based on current demand \n",
