and Governance Report
2019–2020



About this Report
American Airlines is committed to providing regular and transparent 
information about our strategies and performance on the environ-
mental, social and governance (ESG) issues that are most important 
to our company and our stakeholders. We have produced an annual 
Corporate Responsibility Report since 2007, but this year’s report 
marks a new phase in the evolution of our reporting. We seek to 
adhere to best practices for ESG disclosure, so for the first time we 
are aligning our report with the recommendations of the Task Force 
on Climate-related Financial Disclosures (TCFD) and the standard 
for the airline industry developed by the Sustainability Accounting 
Standards Board (SASB). We view both of these reporting frame-
works as important indicators of the ESG issues that investors and 
others consider most material. To reflect our updated reporting 
strategy, we are adopting the title ESG Report going forward. We 
intend to continue providing our stakeholders with information on  
our ESG performance annually. 

In this 2019–2020 ESG Report, we include a discussion of American’s 
approach to managing our most material ESG issues, along with 
highlights of our progress and performance in 2019 and, where 
relevant, into 2020. Unless noted otherwise, performance data is  
as of December 31, 2019.

 Message from 
 Our Chairman 
 and CEO
Companies today face growing expectations to demonstrate they are 
effectively managing, measuring and reporting on environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) issues. At American Airlines, we welcome this 
scrutiny. We know that rigorous ESG management is critical not only 
to the long-term success of our company, but also to the health of the 
planet we all share. While we have long focused on these issues, this 
year’s ESG Report — which is our first aligned with the standards of 
both the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures and the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board — marks a new point in the 
evolution of our ESG approach and transparency.

A key focus of this report is our strategy for addressing climate change. 
Investors and other stakeholders rightly expect us to demonstrate that 
we understand the risks that climate change presents for our business 
and are taking steps to get on a low-carbon path. The science makes 
clear that getting on this path requires significant reductions in green-
house gas (GHG) emissions — and that is why we’ve set a new goal  
to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 

Reaching this ambitious goal will require operational, technological, 
policy and market advances, many of which are outside of our direct 
control. Our strategy is focused on driving improvements within our 
operations while helping to facilitate the broader changes needed to 
enable the transition to low-carbon aviation. We have made significant 
investments in fleet renewal that have given American the youngest 
fleet of any U.S. network carrier. And, as a result of COVID-19, we are 
retiring older, less fuel-efficient aircraft even more quickly. Acceler-
ating the commercial availability and use of sustainable aviation fuel 
(SAF) — which can reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% 
compared with conventional jet fuel — is another critical part of our 
long-term carbon-reduction pathway. We’ve committed to purchase  
9 million gallons of SAF over three years and, in parallel, are working 
to make our operations more fuel efficient. 

We’re committed to advancing these efforts even as we work to 
shepherd our company through one of its most challenging periods. 
The COVID-19 pandemic has brought unprecedented disruption to 
our industry. Throughout the crisis, we have worked to care for our 
team members and customers, restore confidence in air travel and 
strengthen our financial footing. I couldn’t be prouder of the way our 
team members are taking care of our customers and each other as 
we deal with this crisis. With demand for air travel still dramatically 
reduced, however, we have also had to become a smaller airline for at 
least a period of time, including making painful reductions to our team.

The past year has tested our mettle in other ways as well. Our nation is 
reckoning with senseless murders of Black Americans, systemic racism 
and inequality. It is clear that we must redouble our efforts to do what 

is right. As an airline, creating connections is our business; we exist  
to bring the world and people closer together. Fundamental to this  
is our unequivocal belief that the lives of our Black team members,  
customers and community members matter. We know actions are  
more important than words, so we are taking concrete steps to translate  
our conviction into meaningful change, starting within our company. 

We are listening to and learning from the experiences of our Black 
colleagues and customers and partnering with them to develop 
solutions to the issues they have raised. We are taking a hard look at 
our own policies, hiring, customer service practices, training programs 
and policy advocacy to identify how we can do a better job to support 
our team members, diversify our talent pipeline and be responsive to 
our customers. We know we have work to do, and we pledge to do it. 

The confluence of the increasingly visible effects of climate change, 
the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and urgent calls for racial justice 
underscore why our focus on ESG is so critical: It has never been 
more clear that we have to work harder to build a more resilient 
and just society, economy and planet. At American Airlines, we are 
determined to do our part.

and Approach

At American Airlines, we know that rigorous management of environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) issues is critical to the long-term success of our company 
and our planet. This includes effectively governing our business and holding 
ourselves accountable on a set of key issues that are important to our company 
and our stakeholders. It also means being responsive to our stakeholders and 
transparent about our performance.

M
anagement of ESG issues is integral to how we operate our 
business and is embedded within our corporate strategy 
and objectives. While many issues that fall under the ESG 
umbrella are not new for our company — indeed, a key 

reason American has thrived for more than 90 years is because we 
have long recognized the importance of these issues — we have 
recently worked to develop a more integrated approach to ESG 
management, measurement and reporting. 

Our Material Issues 
Our ESG strategy focuses on the issues that are most important to 
our company and our stakeholders. Since 2009, we have undertaken 
periodic materiality assessments to evaluate areas of risk and opportu-
nity, as well as the concerns and expectations of our stakeholders. We 
conducted our most recent assessment process in 2018, and in 2020 
we reviewed this analysis. One key new input to our analysis was the 
Sustainability Accounting Standards Board’s standards for airlines; we 
consider these standards an important indicator of investor perspec-
tives on the most material ESG issues for our industry.

Through this latest review, we affirmed that the material issues we had 
identified remain relevant, though in some instances we refined their 
scope and how we prioritize them. 

Our top material ESG issues are: 

 • Climate change and fuel efficiency

 • Customer satisfaction and operational performance 

 • Diversity, equity and inclusion

 • Safety (including flight safety and team member health and safety)

 • Team member and labor relations

Management and Governance 
Since ESG issues touch nearly every aspect of our business, day-to-day 
management of the individual elements is distributed throughout our 
operations and functions. As part of our effort to take a more integrated  
approach to ESG management, we have recently taken steps to enhance 
our leadership and coordination of ESG efforts and reconsider the way 
these issues are overseen by our Board of Directors. 

We formally placed responsibility for companywide ESG efforts in our 
Corporate Affairs group, with a team that already had responsibility for 
some of the major building blocks, including corporate governance, 
government relations, labor relations and real estate. We recruited a 
new Managing Director for ESG in 2019 and reorganized our sustain-
ability group under her leadership. In 2020, we also reconstituted 
our Sustainability Steering Committee, which is a cross-functional 

American Airlines 2019–2020 ESG Report 4

and cross-operational group of leaders from across our business, led 
by our Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs. We tasked the 
committee with advising on the development of American’s updated 
climate change strategy (see p. 14). 

Although our full Board continues to oversee our ESG efforts, we 
assigned primary responsibility for coordinating oversight to the 
Board’s Corporate Governance and Public Responsibility Committee 
(formerly known as the Nominating and Corporate Governance 
Committee) and updated its charter in 2020 to document this role. 

Public Policy and  
Political Contributions
Engaging in the political, legislative and regulatory process is 
important to our success, and we have adopted policies that set 
forth how we do so. 

In 2020, we updated our Statement on Public Policy Engagement 
and Political Participation to better reflect best practices. This 
includes committing to not use corporate funds for a wide range 
of political activities, including contributions to candidates, 
political party committees and political action committees. We 
also commit to not use corporate funds for the electioneering 
activities that the Supreme Court allowed in Citizens United. On 
the rare occasion when we do use corporate funds to contribute 
to a state or local ballot initiative or a 501(c)(4) organization, we  
committed to disclose that contribution. We also updated the 
charter for the Board’s Corporate Governance and Public Respon-
sibility Committee to clarify that it oversees the company’s major 
advocacy priorities and activities, principal trade association 
memberships and political contributions. 

Team members may voluntarily participate in the political 
process by joining the company’s nonpartisan political action 
committee (PAC), the American Airlines PAC, which is governed by 
comprehensive federal, state and local regulations that require 
filing monthly reports with the Federal Election Commission, 
among other reporting and disclosure requirements. American’s 
Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs and the Board’s 
Corporate Governance and Public Responsibility Committee 
oversee the company’s political engagements and compliance 
with our policies. 

For more information, please see our Statement on Public Policy  
Engagement and Political Participation.

corporate governance policies and pro-
cedures, including committee charters

Addressing 
Climate Change

7

CEO Message Strategy Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB DataClimate



Climate change is a pressing global challenge, and American Airlines believes we 
must do our part to address it. That is why we have set a new goal to achieve net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050. While ambition is important, we know that what 
matters most is that we have a clear roadmap — with both a long-term vision and 
intermediate milestones — for how we will achieve it.

W
e have launched an effort to build American’s carbon 
reduction pathway to 2050 and to refine and expand 
our strategy for addressing the risks and opportunities 
associated with climate change. This report is our first 

step toward both efforts, and we intend to develop intermediate 
goals once our demand forecast is stabilized following the disruption 
caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. 

We expect there will be a higher price on carbon in the future — 
which reinforces our intention to drive to net zero — and we are 
developing a strategy to position our company to succeed. 

While there are many steps we can take to reduce our carbon footprint, 
transitioning to a low- or no-carbon aviation future will depend on 
the combined efforts of the private sector and effective policies from 
governments at all levels, along with advances in airframe, engine and 
fuel technologies. We are committed to helping lead the way. 

Advancing Industry Goals
The global airline industry contributes about 2% of all human-induced 
carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, and our industry’s share of global 
emissions is projected to rise. Our industry is one of the few sectors 
that has established global CO2 emissions goals, which include an 
average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5% per year from 2009 to 
2020, carbon-neutral growth after 2020 and a 50% reduction in net 
aviation CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2050. 

To achieve these important industry goals, American adopted two 
environmental sustainability targets for our own operations: attain  
an average improvement in fuel efficiency of 1.5% per year from 2014 

Our Goals

Achieve net zero direct  
carbon emissions by 2050

Source 2.5 million gigajoules (GJ)  
of renewable energy by 2025

Attain a 1.5% improvement  
in average fuel efficiency from  
2014 through 2020, or 9%  

cumulatively over the six years

(the first full year after we merged with US Airways) through 2020, 
and source 2.5 GJ of renewable energy by 2025. In addition, along 
with others in our industry, we are subject to the Carbon Offsetting 
and Reduction Scheme for International Aviation (CORSIA), which 
aims to achieve carbon-neutral growth in CO2 emissions from interna-
tional aviation after 2020. Adopted by the United Nations’ International 
Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 2016 and currently being imple-
mented by the United States and countries around the world, CORSIA 
is the first global carbon pricing mechanism covering an entire sector. 

American supports our industry’s goals — but we believe the scale 
of the climate challenge, and the science behind it, demands that  

we increase the scale of our company’s ambitions to achieve net zero 
carbon emissions by 2050. As one of the world’s largest airlines, we 
know we need to be a leader in helping to drive the operational, policy 
and technological changes needed to reduce CO2 emissions from air 
travel to try to limit global warming to 1.5° Celsius, which is the limit 
advised by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) to 
avoid the most damaging and irreversible impacts of climate change. 

While the COVID-19 crisis has upended our industry and compelled 
us to adjust the pace of some of our efforts, it has not diminished 
our belief in the importance of addressing climate change. Instead, 
the pandemic has underscored the need for collective action to 

address critical global challenges that have profound implications 
for people and economies and reinforced our work to make our 
company stronger and more resilient.

In the remainder of this section, we detail our carbon footprint and 
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions performance trends, discuss our 
strategy for addressing climate change, report on our analysis of 
climate-related risks and opportunities and describe the company’s 
governance of climate-related issues. 

American Airlines is proud to be part of the oneworld® alliance, 
which in September 2020 became the first global airline alliance 
to unite behind a common target to achieve carbon neutrality. 
Each member airline in the alliance will develop its individual 
approach to reach the target of net zero carbon emissions by 
2050, through various initiatives such as efficiency measures, 
investments in sustainable aviation fuels and more fuel-efficient 
aircraft and carbon offsets, among other measures.

Carbon Anatomy of a Flight
Many factors determine the amount of GHG emissions associated with a  
particular flight. Fuel efficiency of the aircraft is a key factor, but it ’s not the  
only one — and efficiency itself is influenced by a complex set of variables.  

Here are the main determinants of a flight’s carbon footprint:

Distance of flight
The takeoff and climb phases of a 
flight burn more fuel than the cruising 
or landing phases, which makes 
shorter flights less fuel efficient  
than long-haul flights.

Number of passengers
While the number of seats on a plane determines the 
maximum passenger capacity, any given flight may 
operate with fewer passengers. Operating at or close 
to the maximum capacity increases fuel efficiency.

Cargo
Many passenger flights also carry cargo, which 
may include mail and items like medicines that 
need to get to their destination quickly. This 
adds revenue and increases efficiency.

Type of fuel
While the vast majority of aviation 
fuel used today is petroleum-based, 
sustainable aviation fuel from 
renewable feedstocks can cut 
lifecycle carbon emissions  
related to fuel by up to 80%. 

On the ground
Single-engine taxiing and the use of 
high-speed tugs reduce the amount 
of jet fuel needed to move aircraft on 
the ground. And operators plug into 
grid electricity at the gate, which is 
typically less carbon intensive than 
using the plane’s auxiliary power.

Aircraft design
Modern aircraft incorporate many features to save fuel, including 
the use of lightweight materials, aerodynamic design and more 
fuel-efficient engines.

One way airlines measure fuel efficiency and 
GHG intensity is by dividing absolute fuel use 
or emissions by revenue ton miles (RTM). 

RTM is the weight of revenue-generating pas-
sengers and cargo, and it — along with GHG  
intensity — is affected by the following factors:

Many aircraft have winglets, which are 
small additions at the end of wings  
that reduce drag and can improve fuel  
efficiency by up to 4%. 

Fuel efficiency is so sensitive to the 
weight of an aircraft that using a thinner 
paint across a fleet could save a million 
gallons of fuel each year.

Seats on the plane
The number of seats on a given aircraft varies  

depending on how it is configured — such as the 
space devoted to first-class seating, galleys and bath-
rooms — and the design of the seats themselves.

0.5%

Our Carbon Footprint
Nearly all — 99% — of the GHG emissions from American’s direct 
operations result from burning jet fuel. So reducing our consumption 
of petroleum-based jet fuel is the single best way we can reduce 
our carbon footprint. A variety of factors — from the aircraft we fly 
to where and how we fly them — affect our fuel use and associated 
emissions. We have taken a range of actions to be more fuel efficient 
in our operations and increase our use of renewable energy (see  
Our Strategy on p. 14). We have made progress — but we know we 
have more to do.

Our GHG Emissions in 2019
American’s Scope 1 (direct) GHG emissions — which account for 
about two-thirds of our GHG footprint — stem almost entirely from 
the burning of jet fuel by our aircraft, plus a small portion from the 
fuel used by our ground service equipment. Our Scope 2 emissions 
include emissions associated with the purchase of electricity to run 
our operations, and they make up the smallest portion of our carbon 
footprint (0.5%). Our estimated Scope 3 (upstream and downstream) 
emissions are nearly 35% of our overall emissions, the largest 
element of which is upstream emissions associated with the 
production of jet fuel, followed by emissions from our third-party 
regional carriers and those associated with purchased goods and 
services and team member travel. 

Fuel-Efficiency Performance
We improved the average fuel efficiency of our mainline operations  
by 7.4% between 2014 and 2019, including a 0.8% improvement 
during 2019 alone. 

We typically track efficiency using revenue ton miles (RTM), which 
measure the fuel needed (and associated GHG emissions) to fly one 
ton of payload — the combined weight of passengers, their bags and

cargo on an aircraft — one mile. The less fuel needed per RTM, the 
more efficient the flight. Consistent with the industry’s goal, we set a 
target to improve our fuel efficiency by an average of 1.5% annually — 
or 9% cumulatively — from 2014 to 2020.

While we were just shy of achieving our cumulative goal of a 7.5% 
improvement by year-end 2019 in our mainline operations, improving 
efficiency in our regional operations has been more challenging. In 
2019, we achieved a 2% efficiency improvement in our regional opera-
tions, but our cumulative improvement since 2014 is 1.6%. Collectively, 
our mainline and regional operations have achieved a 5.3% efficiency 
improvement since 2014. 

Absolute Emissions
In 2019, our Scope 1 emissions were up 2% compared with 2018. 
Since 2005, however, we have reduced our systemwide Scope 1 
emissions by 8% due to improved fuel efficiency, while increasing  
the number of passengers and amount of cargo we carried. 

The increase in emissions in 2019 was driven by growth in our network, 
particularly by our regional carriers. Emissions from our mainline oper-
ations increased 0.6% from 2018 to 2019, whereas emissions from our 
wholly owned regional carriers were up nearly 15% as they flew almost 
75,000 additional flights and added seven new destinations to our route 
map. While only about 12% of our total emissions came from these 
wholly owned regional carriers, they were the fastest-growing part 
of our network, and regional aircraft are on average less fuel efficient 
per ton mile than mainline aircraft (see Community Connectivity and 
Climate Change on p. 13). 

Our Scope 2 (location-based) emissions decreased by 10% in 2019 
because we were able to lower the carbon intensity of the electric 
power we purchased. Our Scope 3 emissions increased by 2% in  
2019 compared to the prior year.

Community Connectivity and Climate Change
Connectivity is at the heart of American’s purpose and value proposition, 
and our regional carriers are an integral part of that. In 2019, approximately 
59 million passengers boarded our regional carriers’ aircraft, more than 
40% of whom connected to or from our mainline flights. 

This is precisely the kind of connectivity that our hub-and-spoke network 
is designed to facilitate: Through our regional carriers, we serve smaller 
communities and low-density markets that don’t have the passenger 
traffic to support larger, mainline aircraft. Then, through our hub airports 
across the United States and our international gateways, we connect 
those passengers to destinations around the world. In fact, American 
provided small communities nearly 60% more one-stop connection 
options than other U.S. network carriers in 2019.2 Thanks to the power  
of our network, we connect more people to more places.

We believe deeply in the value of connectivity. Commercial air service not 
only expands horizons and connects people, it also provides significant 
economic opportunity for local communities. 

But shorter flights on smaller planes come at a fuel-efficiency cost. The 
takeoff and climb phases of a flight burn more fuel than the cruising phase, 
which makes shorter regional flights less fuel efficient than long-haul flights. 
In addition, when we were building out our regional fleet, the advancements 
in aircraft and engine design that have improved the fuel efficiency of our 
mainline fleet were not — and sometimes still aren’t — available on smaller 
aircraft. Altogether, the result is that for each mile we fly a passenger or unit of 
cargo, regional aircraft are on average less fuel efficient than mainline aircraft. 

Our commitment to providing industry-leading regional service makes it 
more challenging for us to meet our fuel-efficiency targets. By appropriately 
balancing our climate change goals with our commitment to connectivity, 
we believe we can best help the communities we serve to thrive.

Our Strategy
American’s strategy to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050 
is focused on driving operational and technical improvements that 
reduce GHG emissions by continuously improving fuel efficiency 
and substituting petroleum-based fuels with lower-carbon alter-
natives. We also expect to rely on market-based mechanisms, 
including carbon offsets, certainly over the short to medium terms 
and potentially over the long term as well, depending on how 
quickly the market for sustainable aviation fuel develops. In parallel, 
we are helping to facilitate the broader policy, market, infrastructure 

and technological advances needed to enable the transition to 
low-carbon aviation. 

We are targeting our efforts where we can have the most mean-
ingful near-term impact in reducing our carbon footprint and  
mitigating our most significant climate-related risks (see Identifying 
and Assessing Climate-Related Risks, p. 20). The following outlines 
the key components of our climate strategy. 

 

Aircraft Fuel Efficiency

Jet fuel consumption is the chief source of our direct GHG emissions 
and one of the largest categories of expense for our company. As 
a result, maximizing the fuel efficiency of our aircraft is both a core 
focus of our climate change strategy and a key business objective. 

Over the past several years, American has undertaken the most exten-
sive fleet renewal effort in the history of our industry. Since 2013, we 
have taken delivery of 550 new, more fuel-efficient aircraft — at a cost 
of $23 billion — including the Boeing 787 and the Airbus 321neo, which 
were developed with the latest engine and airframe technologies.

Over the same period, we retired a similar number of older, less fuel- 
efficient planes, including retiring the last of our McDonnell Douglas 
MD-80 aircraft in 2019. And because of the reduction in demand due 
to the COVID-19 pandemic, we accelerated the retirement of four 
additional aircraft types — Embraer E190s, Boeing 757s, Boeing 767s 
and Airbus A330-300s — and certain older regional aircraft. In addition, 
we anticipate benefiting from increased fuel efficiency as the Boeing 
737 MAX comes back into service. The MAX is 35% more efficient than 
the fleet of Boeing 757s that we retired earlier this year. 

Our fleet renewal effort will have the greatest near-term impact on 
emissions, since each new generation of aircraft targets fuel-efficiency 
improvements of 10–15%, though there are factors beyond the aircraft 
itself that affect fuel efficiency (see Carbon Anatomy of a Flight, p. 10). 
Over the long term, we expect to rely on future technologies, including 
new engine and aircraft technology, air traffic control reform and sustain-
able aviation fuels, to achieve our goal of net zero emissions by 2050. 

Operational Efficiency in the Air and on the Ground
Alongside fleet renewal efforts, we are investing in new technology 
to help our aircraft operate more efficiently. For example, in 2020 we 
began deploying specialized software that uses real-time weather 
conditions to provide our flight crews with better data about optimal 

flight altitudes and speeds. This can save fuel and reduce emissions, 
particularly on long-haul flights. By mid-2020, we were using this 
technology on 85% of our mainline aircraft. 

We are also reducing jet fuel consumption pre- and post-flight. This 
on-the-ground fuel use represents approximately 6% of our total jet fuel 
consumption. For example, we are reducing the use of onboard auxiliary 
power units (APUs) during flight preparation by connecting to ground 
power at the airport terminal, rather than relying on jet fuel to heat or 
cool the aircraft, operate onboard lighting and run other functions while 
the aircraft is parked at the gate. This simple change in operational 
behavior provides a substantial opportunity to decrease both costs and 
emissions, since electric power is less carbon intensive. We estimate 
that by reducing the time an APU is run by just one minute on every 
flight, an aircraft can save 1,000 gallons or more of jet fuel annually. 

Other changes include increasing our use of single-engine taxi 
operation (i.e., using just one aircraft engine to taxi to the gate after 
landing). This technique reduces the carbon emissions produced by 
taxiing by 20–40%.4 We are also working to reduce excess weight on 
each aircraft, from using lighter materials on board to optimizing the 
amount of extra fuel each flight carries.

The next largest source of American’s direct GHG emissions after jet 
fuel — albeit a distant second, representing only 1% of our Scope 1 
emissions — comes from the fuel used by required ground service 
equipment (GSE), such as baggage carts, cargo loaders, pushout 
tractors and maintenance equipment. As part of our climate strategy, 
we are purchasing low-emission GSE vehicles and working to tran-
sition from diesel- or gasoline-powered GSE to electric GSE. In 2019, 
we added more than 50 electric-powered vehicles to our GSE fleet.

The SAF CO2 Lifecycle: From Cooking Oil to Jet Fuel
Here’s the CO2 lifecycle when used cooking oil — a common feedstock used to produce SAF — is converted to jet fuel:

CO2 in the atmosphere is 
absorbed by plants during 

photosynthesis

Plants produce oil 
seeds

Oil seeds are crushed to 
make cooking oil

Used cooking oil is 
collected from restaurants 

Collected oil is 
processed into jet fuel

Jet fuel is combusted during 
flight, which emits CO2

Sustainable Aviation Fuel 
American recognizes that increasing the use of sustainable aviation 
fuel — which can reduce lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% 
compared with conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel — must be 
a core part of our low-carbon pathway. But while the SAF industry 
is continuing to invest and grow production capacity, there remain 
significant challenges to the availability of SAF in the quantities and at 
the prices necessary to materially reduce emissions in the near term. 

In early 2020, we committed to purchase 9 million gallons of SAF over 
three years from Neste, a leading producer of renewable products. This 
SAF will be certified through the International Sustainability and Carbon 
Certification scheme. We began to take delivery of Neste SAF at San 
Francisco International Airport in July 2020. This commitment contributes 
to our goal of sourcing 2.5 million GJ of cost-competitive renewable 
energy by 2025. When announced, our agreement with Neste was the 

largest single SAF purchasing commitment in our industry, but it still 
represents considerably less than 1% of our total annual fuel consump-
tion. Bringing the SAF market to scale will require the combined efforts of 
the private sector and effective policies from governments at all levels. By 
committing to this initial order from Neste, we aim to help facilitate more 
widespread production of SAF and accelerate its commercial viability. 

American is also involved in other efforts and collaborations to build the 
market for SAF and identify other ways to reduce emissions associated 
with aviation. We participate in the World Economic Forum’s Clean 
Skies for Tomorrow Coalition and Business for Social Responsibility’s 
Sustainable Air Freight Alliance. We also participate in the Commercial 
Aviation Alternative Fuels Initiative, which brings together airlines, alter-
native fuel producers, and university and governmental stakeholders. 
And we have on-the-ground efforts at a number of airports — including 
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, San Francisco International 
Airport and Seattle-Tacoma International Airport — to use SAF. 

SAF 101

What is sustainable aviation fuel (SAF)?

SAF is jet fuel produced from renewable hydrocarbon resources, 
including both biological and nonbiological resources. SAF can be 
produced from a range of feedstocks, including municipal solid 
waste, used cooking oil, plant oils, waste gases and agricultural 
residues. SAF is certified as Jet-A1 fuel, which means it meets the 
same performance standards as conventional jet fuel and can be 
used without technical modifications to aircraft.

What are the benefits?

SAF reduces lifecycle GHG emissions by up to 80% compared 
with conventional, petroleum-based jet fuel. To realize this 
benefit, however, SAF must be sustainably produced — using 
feedstocks and methods that don’t compete with food production 
and don’t contribute to deforestation, natural resource depletion 
or climate change. To ensure they don’t, airlines are encouraged 
to follow rigorous, independently verified sustainability standards 
for SAF production.

What are the challenges? 

SAF is available now — but at smaller quantities and a significant 
price premium compared with conventional kerosene (fossil-
based) jet fuel, because the SAF market is still at a nascent 
stage of development. To be a feasible alternative for widespread 
commercial use, SAF must be cost-competitive with conventional 
jet fuel and must not be disadvantaged relative to other fuels 
because of incentive programs. It also must be available at scale. 
And that requires both investments in production capacity and 
smart government policies.

Carbon Offsets
While the core focus of American’s climate strategy is increasing effi-
ciency and reducing emissions, we recognize that carbon offsets also 
have a role to play. As part of our support for CORSIA, we endorsed 
the industry goal to achieve carbon-neutral growth in emissions 
from international aviation after 2020, relative to a baseline set at the 
average of 2019 and 2020 emissions. 

However, the collapse in demand for air travel in 2020 because of 
COVID-19 distorted the planned baseline. To bring the costs of compli-
ance in line with what was originally intended, the industry petitioned 
to change the CORSIA baseline to include only 2019 emissions levels. 
Such a change was vital to keeping the credibility and feasibility of 

CORSIA intact. In mid-2020, the ICAO decided that 2019 emissions 
will serve as the baseline for the first phase of CORSIA implementation 
(2021–2023), and that in 2022 it will consider the baseline for CORSIA’s 
later phases.

In addition, in 2020, we introduced a customer-facing carbon offset 
program, enabling our passengers to offset their emissions from air 
travel. The program enables customers to purchase verified offsets 
through Cool Effect, a nonprofit organization. Customers can purchase 
offsets in a portfolio of projects that include work to prevent deforesta-
tion in Brazil and protect peat marshlands in Indonesia (see photo at 
left). For more information, see www.cooleffect/american-airlines. 

Renewable Energy Use in Our Facilities
Over the past several years, we have expanded our use of renewable 
energy to power our administrative, ground and support operations. 
While emissions associated with the purchase of electricity to run 
our operations comprise the smallest portion of our carbon footprint, 
switching to renewable energy provides an immediate opportunity to 
reduce our GHG emissions. 

We have focused our renewable energy efforts on our primary facilities 
in North Texas, where we have our largest airport operation, and our 
Fort Worth campus, which includes our integrated operations center, 
the majority of our training facilities, a large call center and our principal 
offices. The electricity used on our campus and at our Dallas/Fort 
Worth International Airport terminals and facilities is from renewable 
sources. As of April 2020, American was the highest-ranked trans-
portation company — and among the top 50 companies overall —  
on the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA’s) Green Power 
Partnership Fortune 500® Partners List.

We have also undertaken a range of other initiatives to make our new 
and existing facilities more energy efficient and sustainable (see Our 
Other Environmental Efforts, p. 19).

Public Policy and Collaboration
We recognize that we cannot achieve our ambitious goal of net 
zero carbon emissions by 2050 on our own. Given the nature of 
the climate challenge and of our industry, achieving our goal will 
depend not only on our own efforts but also on sound policy and 
meaningful collaboration across the public and private sectors.

For example, smart policies that help the nascent SAF market to 
grow to commercial scale will be critical. In all future projections 
of low- or no-carbon aviation, SAF must play an increasingly large 
role in satisfying fuel demand. But current production levels are 
well below the scale needed to make SAF cost-competitive with 
conventional jet fuel. Through incentives, credits, investments 
in research and other policy tools, governments can create the 
market conditions needed to make SAF an economically viable 
alternative to conventional jet fuel. 

Another high-impact way to reduce GHG emissions associated 
with aviation in the United States would be to modernize our air 
traffic control (ATC) system. This would help to alleviate congestion 
and reduce delays that result in additional fuel consumption and  
associated emissions — not to mention frustration for passen-
gers. ATC reform is projected to bring up to 12% fuel and emissions  
savings. But developing and implementing a more modern and 
efficient ATC system requires government and our industry to 
work together (see p. 18). 

In these and other areas, we believe it is important for our company 
to play a constructive role in advancing policies that are consistent 
with the goals of the Paris Agreement. That’s why we supported 
the Business Roundtable’s September 2020 update of its principles 
and policies addressing climate change. The update prioritizes 
the alignment of climate goals with scientific evidence, interna-
tional engagement and support for investments in innovation.

Modernizing Our Air Traffic  
Control System 
Our Air Traffic Control (ATC) system is a vital part of our country’s 
transportation infrastructure — equally important to the economy 
and society as the bridges, highways, rails and roads we travel on the 
ground. The design and operation of our ATC system also has environ-
mental implications: The more efficiently aircraft can travel our routes in 
the skies, the less fuel they burn and the fewer emissions they produce.

While the United States has the safest ATC system in the world, it 
continues to rely too heavily on outdated technology and processes 
that are inefficient or poorly equipped to accommodate growing air 
traffic. At the same time, the complexity of our air space is expanding 
rapidly — from the dramatic uptick in drone use to emerging urban  
air mobility technologies. 

To keep pace with these demands — and to help reduce aviation’s 
impact on the climate — it is essential we modernize our ATC system, 
which in turn can reduce millions of tons of CO2 each year. However, it 
must have the best technology and the operational agility and flexibility 
to deploy it fully and quickly. This goal requires timely and effective 
government policies that ensure an integrated approach by airlines, 
airports and air traffic management.

Realizing the Promise of NextGen
NextGen is the common term for the Federal Aviation Administration’s 
(FAA) plan to modernize the country’s network of aviation infrastructure, 
technology and services. A key part of NextGen involves moving from 
outdated radar technology to a primarily satellite-enabled navigation 
system, backed up by more sophisticated radar, which will allow FAA 
and operators to create optimal flight paths and arrival and landing 
operations — significantly reducing flying time and GHG emissions. 

A critical part of enhancing the efficiency of air traffic management 
is strengthening the ability of FAA to deploy and, in partnership 
with airlines and airports, to accelerate and operationalize NextGen 
capabilities and the next generation of technological advancements.

The ATC and Climate Connection
About a third of all flight delays are caused by solvable ATC issues, often unrelated to airline operations. The congestion, delays and diversions that 
result from our outmoded ATC system significantly increase fuel burn and GHG emissions. Inefficiencies in our current ATC system increase 
emissions from gate to gate: 

On the ground

Delays and congestion result in aircraft 
spending more time on the taxiway waiting for 

departure slots and gates upon arrival 

Takeoff and landing

Outdated technology and procedures often 
force aircraft to forgo the most fuel-efficient 
continuous climb and descent operations

In the air

Indirect flight paths increase flight time and fuel 
burn, while inefficient air-space management 
can require additional separation between 
aircraft while en route and more aircraft in 
holding patterns awaiting clearance to land

6. https://www.faa.gov/nextgen/media/BusinessCaseForNextGen-2016.pdf

Up to 12% reduction in fuel use and GHG 
emissions can be achieved by completing 
the transition to a satellite-based 
navigation system5

The FAA anticipates that through 2030, 
NextGen’s benefits include:

Reducing CO2 emissions by 27 million 
metric tons — equivalent to taking 5.9 
million cars off the road6

Eliminating 38% of delays, saving $106.7 
billion in passenger value of time

Our Other Environmental Efforts
While reducing our carbon footprint is the most significant way American  
can minimize our impact on the environment, we also work hard to improve  
environmental sustainability across our operations. For example:

Environmental Management

In 2019, American became the first major U.S. carrier to begin the process of seeking certification 
for our environmental management system under the International Air Transport Association’s 
Environmental Assessment (IEnvA) program, which assesses airline performance against 
sustainability standards for air quality and emissions, noise, fuel consumption, recycling and 
sustainable procurement. Airlines certified under IEnvA standards will also be ISO 14001 certified.

Green Building

We are integrating green building principles — such as energy efficiency, water conservation and 
sustainable materials — into our new and renovated facilities. We have multiple LEED Gold- and 
Silver-certified facilities across the United States; most recently, we opened two new LEED 
Gold-certified buildings — called Skyview 7 and 8 — at our corporate headquarters campus in 
Fort Worth in 2019. The buildings’ sustainable design features include the use of materials that 
meet stringent requirements for low or no volatile organic compounds, preferred parking for 
zero- and low-emitting vehicles and a 97% diversion of construction waste to landfills. Skyview 8  
also boasts a 41% reduction in water use compared with standard practices through its high- 
efficiency water fixtures and other features. The new campus replaced 21 acres of formerly 
concrete surfaces with water-efficient landscaping, which included planting 3,000 trees. 

Aircraft Noise

We recognize and are committed to addressing the ongoing concerns of local communities 
regarding aircraft noise. Our fleet of mainline aircraft is the youngest among U.S. network carriers, 
and these newer aircraft are up to 50% quieter than the aircraft they replaced. We are proud of the 
fact that our entire mainline and regional fleet of aircraft meets ICAO Chapter 4 noise certification 
standards. American continues our work with airports, communities and the Federal Aviation 
Administration (FAA) to find reasonable solutions.

Renewable Energy

We have set a goal to source 2.5 million GJ of cost-competitive renewable energy to power our 
operations by 2025 — the equivalent of nearly 20 million gallons of jet fuel. In 2019, we sourced nearly 
200,000 GJ through the purchase of electricity from renewable sources for our headquarters facilities 
and operations at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport, which are 100% powered by renewable 
energy. As of April 2020, American was the highest-ranked transportation company — and among the  
top 50 companies overall — on the U.S. EPA’s Green Power Partnership Fortune 500® Partners List.

Energy Efficiency

We are taking steps across all of our facilities to make them more energy efficient. For example, 
we are re-lighting our 13 hangar facilities with high-efficiency LED lights, which use only 20% of 
the electricity of the lights they replace. In 2019, we completed the re-lighting of our maintenance 
facility in Pittsburgh — bringing to five the number of hangar facilities where we’ve made the switch 
to 100% LED — and we are well on our way to completing the effort at the remaining ones. 

Waste Reduction and Recycling

We have a variety of efforts aimed at reducing waste and increasing recycling onboard our 
aircraft and within our facilities. On average, American recycles about 340,000 pounds of 
aluminum cans annually through our flight services. And we have changed our processes and 
materials — including by switching from plastic to bamboo stir sticks — to eliminate thousands  
of pounds of unnecessary plastic in 2019. 

During the COVID-19 pandemic, we adjusted our onboard meal service to protect the health and 
safety of our passengers and team members. Some of these adjustments, such as providing bottles 
of water rather than refilling cups to minimize contact, present challenges to advancing our waste 
and recycling goals. As soon as it’s safe to do so, we will ramp up and launch a range of planned 
new efforts to reduce, reuse and recycle across our operations.

For data on our performance related to energy use, air 
emissions, waste, water, noise and other environmental topics, 
see p. 54.

Identifying and Assessing  
Climate-Related Risks
We know that effectively managing and mitigating the climate-related 
risks facing our company starts with a comprehensive understanding 
of those risks and their potential impacts on our business, operations 
and the broader environment in which we work. This insight is a key 
basis for our updated climate strategy and lays the foundation for 
more deeply integrating climate risk analysis into our ongoing risk 
management and business planning processes. 

Our Process
Through our existing enterprisewide risk management process, 
American monitors and manages a broad range of strategic, financial 
and operational risks, including certain climate change risks. To develop 
a more robust understanding of the climate risk landscape, in 2020 we 
launched a process focused specifically on identifying and assessing 
the climate-related risks facing our company over the short, medium 
and long terms. The initial qualitative phase, in which we considered 
both physical and transition risks, informs future quantitative analysis, 
and we will continue to refine and improve the process.

This process — and our related reporting — has been informed by 
the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures, the leading 
framework for disclosure on climate-related risk.

Physical Risk Assessment 
We focused our physical risk analysis on 10 strategically important 
sites for our company: the nine hub airports that form the foundation 
of our network, and our largest maintenance facility, which is in Tulsa, 
Oklahoma. Our largest hub, in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas, is also home 
to our corporate headquarters, our integrated operations center and 
our primary training facility.

The Task Force on Climate-related 
Financial Disclosures divides risks into 
two categories: 

Risks related to the physical impacts of 
climate change, including from acute 
weather events and chronic changes to 
the climate that may present operational 
risk for companies

Risks related to the transition to a lower-
carbon economy, including the policy, 
legal, technology and market changes 
that may pose financial and reputational 
risk for companies

American Airlines 2019–2020 ESG Report 20

CEO Message Strategy Safety Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB DataClimate



For each site, we considered the likelihood and implications of acute 
risks, such as extreme weather events, and chronic risks, such as 
sustained increased temperatures. We looked first at historical trends 
and impacts, including changes between 1990 and 2018, and then at 
projections for 2035 and 2060. We based these future projections on 
the IPCC’s Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 emissions 
scenario, which assumes essentially “business as usual” between now 
and 2100. We chose the high-emissions RCP 8.5 scenario because it 
produces an up-to-6° C rise in global temperatures, which would cause 
the most significant potential physical impacts on our facilities, creating 
an upper-level boundary condition for our analysis. 

We identified and assessed potential physical risks from chronic 
changes in climate norms (such as rising sea levels, increasing 
temperatures and changes in precipitation) and acute events (such  
as cyclones, flooding, drought and extreme heat). We used down-
scaled climate data and projections that enabled us to evaluate the 
likelihood that climate-related impacts will affect our operations at 
each of the 10 sites in the assessment in 2035 and 2060. Our sources 
included data from the U.S. Global Change Research Program’s 
Fourth National Climate Assessment, Climate Central’s States at Risk, 
the U.S. EPA’s Climate Resilience Evaluation & Awareness Tool, and 
other relevant resources for non-U.S. data where needed. 

We then established criteria to evaluate the relative business impor-
tance of each site — such as capital assets on site and flight activity 
— and combined that value-at-risk assessment with the hazards 
assessment. Taken together, this analysis will help us determine 
resilience investment priorities and mitigation strategies. 

Transition Risk Assessment
We also looked at American’s exposure to transition risks related to 
climate change, including the policy and legal, technology, market, 
reputation and operational risks — as well as opportunities — that 
could arise from the transition to a low-carbon or carbon-constrained 
economy. 

We based our analysis on the International Energy Agency’s (IEA’s) 
2019 World Energy Outlook global climate change scenarios, which 
include a 6° C Current Policies scenario that generally aligns with 
the higher-emissions RCP 8.5 scenario we used for our physical 
risk assessment, a 2.7° C Stated Policies Scenario in which the 
policies agreed to as part of the Paris Agreement are enacted, and 
a 1.65°–1.85° C Sustainable Development Scenario that would align 
with net zero carbon by 2070. 

For each scenario, we assessed policy assumptions for major emitting 
countries and cross-cutting global policies, along with transport 
sector assumptions. We also looked at GDP and population growth 
assumptions by region and the forecasted price of carbon and crude 
oil under the scenarios. We recognize that in 2020 the COVID-19 
pandemic created a dramatic and unanticipated shock to the global 
economy and policy landscape that will affect these scenarios, but 
because material policy changes are likely to take effect gradually, the 
impact of the pandemic on these variables is likely to grow increasingly 

muted in the medium and long terms. As a result, we believe they 
remain useful analytical tools for establishing a climate-related risk 
assessment process that can be refined. 

We then engaged leaders and experts from across our business and 
operations to qualitatively assess the potential transition risks and 
opportunities, based on the different assumptions (see table on p. 22).  
We used this analysis to inform our strategy for mitigating climate-
related risk and driving progress toward our company’s longer-term 
goal of net zero carbon emissions by 2050. 

Our Findings
The initial qualitative phase of our assessment yielded important insights 
into the nature, likelihood and projected impact of climate-related risks 
facing American currently and in the medium and long terms (in 2035 
and 2060, respectively). We are using these insights to guide our climate 
change strategy and goals, develop mitigation strategies and inform 
future analysis of the financial impacts of the risks identified.

Policy  
and legal

The risk from existing and 
emerging regulation aimed at 
addressing climate change. 
This might include: 
 • Increased pricing of GHG 
emissions

 • Enhanced reporting 
obligations

 • Exposure to litigation
 • Limits on a license to 
operate

New carbon taxes could increase the price of jet fuel, 
which would raise our operating costs and potentially 
reduce demand for travel.

Regional or country-specific aviation emission reduction 
policies could undercut CORSIA’s place as a single global 
approach to addressing international aviation emissions, 
raising our compliance and reporting costs and potentially 
impacting our international joint venture contracts.

Policymakers in the U.S. could enact laws setting domestic 
emission reduction targets for airlines, which could limit our 
ability to grow. They could also mandate new technologies 
that would impose significant capital and operating costs on 
us to meet those requirements.

We are developing a robust and multifaceted long-term climate 
change strategy aimed at driving progress toward ambitious goals 
and positioning our company to be a leader on sustainability. 

We monitor emerging regulations around the world to understand  
the risks and opportunities for our business. And we work with 
policymakers to identify policy solutions that can help the aviation 
industry reduce its emissions through new technologies. We also 
continue to advocate for CORSIA as the single global approach to 
addressing emissions from international aviation. 

We continue to seek efficiency gains in our operations, pursue 
opportunities to employ SAF and seek to employ lower-emission 
or zero-emission technologies as they become available on a 
commercially reasonable basis.

Technology The risk from emerging tech-
nologies aimed at supporting 
the global low-carbon transi-
tion. This might include:
 • Substitution of existing 
products and services with 
lower-emission options

 • Upfront costs to transition to 
lower-emission technology 

Recent completion of our fleet renewal program gives us 
the youngest fleet among U.S. network carriers; however, 
more aggressive emission constraints imposed in the 
near to medium term may place us at a disadvantage to 
competitors who are beginning to upgrade their fleets to 
the most recent generation of aircraft.

There is a risk that technology does not develop suffi-
ciently to allow us to meet our ambitious climate goals.

Since 2013, we have undertaken an extensive fleet replacement initia-
tive, taking delivery of 550 new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, including 
the Boeing 787 Dreamliner and the Airbus 321neo, which are among 
the most fuel-efficient aircraft on the market. Over the same period, 
we retired a similar number of older, less fuel-efficient aircraft. 

We will continue to engage with SAF producers and airframe and 
aircraft engine manufacturers to better understand new low-carbon 
technologies that may become available over our planning horizon.

Market The risk from shifting supply 
and demand as economies 
react to climate change. This 
might include:
 • Changing customer behavior
 • Uncertainty in market signals
 • Increased cost of raw 
materials

Business customers may choose to use alternatives to 
travel, such as virtual meetings and workspaces.

The collateral we use to secure loans — in the form of 
aircraft, spare parts and airport slots — could lose value 
as customer demand shifts and economies move to 
low-carbon alternatives.

Greater development of high-speed rail in markets now 
served by short-haul flights could provide passengers 
with lower-carbon alternatives to flying with us.

We recently introduced a carbon offsetting opportunity for our 
customers as a way to enable to them to travel efficiently while 
also offsetting the GHG impact of their flights. We intend to further 
integrate other sustainability practices into the products, services 
and experiences we offer our customers. 

We will deepen our customer relationships by partnering with a range 
of stakeholders, including governments, manufacturers, suppliers and 
customers, on sustainability initiatives that have the potential to boost 
low-carbon pathways, such as sustainable aviation fuels.

Reputation The risks of damage to brand 
value and loss of customer 
base from shifting public 
sentiment about climate 
change. This may include:

 • Shifts in customer prefer-
ences

 • Stigmatization of the sector

 • Increased stakeholder 
concern

Growing recognition among U.S. consumers that climate 
change is a serious danger may mean some customers 
choose to fly less frequently or fly on an airline they 
perceive as more sustainable.

Investors may demand more aggressive sustainability 
goals and practices from our industry.

We are developing a robust and multifaceted long-term climate 
change strategy aimed at driving progress toward ambitious goals 
and positioning our company to be a leader on sustainability.

We intend to continue our efforts to reduce carbon emissions using 
the various levers available to us at this time — including consider-
ation of how to include modern aircraft, efficient technology, sound 
operational practices and sustainable fuels — in our overall climate 
mitigation strategy. We are looking to embrace new low-carbon  
levers as they become available.

We also plan to continue to communicate our sustainability practices  
to our customers, team members and suppliers so they understand  
the measures we are taking to reduce our climate impact.

Acute The risk of increasing severity 
of weather events

Extremely high temperatures may exceed the maximum 
allowable temperature at which our aircraft are certified 
by the FAA to operate.

Increases in hot days can interrupt our operations by 
causing heat buckling on runways and taxiways and 
other infrastructure damage. Such damage in turn can 
increase operational and repair costs for airports —  
costs that would be passed through to us.

In extreme cases, it may become difficult to cool aircraft 
to an acceptable temperature for customers and crew.

We will continue to monitor temperatures at airports exposed to acute 
temperature risk and work with aircraft manufacturers to ensure that 
our aircraft are able to operate safely under a range  
of operational conditions. 

Over the next five years, we intend to incorporate the projected impacts 
of climate change into design standards for physical assets, capital 
improvement plans, disaster management, emergency response  
and scheduling.

To mitigate projected impacts from increasing temperatures, we plan 
to invest in additional ground cooling and upgrades to gate-based 
cooling systems.

Increased frequency and intensity of hurricanes places 
operations and infrastructure at Miami International 
Airport at risk. Increases in storm activities can result  
in substantial costs relating to canceled flights and 
airport closures.

We are investigating options to mitigate the impacts of hurricanes, 
which may include enhancing airport infrastructure to withstand 
stronger winds from storms.

Acute 
(continued)

The risk of increasing severity 
of weather events

Flooding from intense precipitation at major hubs in 
Charlotte, North Carolina; Los Angeles; and London 
can interrupt critical expansion strategies. Increases in 
precipitation can result in excess loading of stormwater 
infrastructure designed for lesser flows, increasing the 
risk of flooding. Increases in the severity of storms can 
cause flooding, which can wear infrastructure.

To mitigate the impact of flooding on infrastructure, we plan to 
incorporate the projected impacts of increasing precipitation into 
design standards for physical assets, capital improvement plans, 
disaster management and emergency response, master plan 
development and early warning systems.

Cyclonic events in the Gulf of Mexico region — where 
almost 50% of U.S. crude oil refining capacity is located 
— can disrupt fuel supplies. A significant portion of 
our fuel is sourced from Gulf of Mexico refineries and 
is stored in, or must be transported from, the region, 
which poses a risk to our operations if those facilities are 
disabled for any period of time. Pipelines and storage 
terminals may also be at risk from extreme weather. 
Terminals may be supplied via ocean-going vessels if 
refineries are shut down, but there are no viable alterna-
tives to move the amount of fuel stranded if pipelines are 
shut down due to flooding or other hurricane impacts.

Our strategies to mitigate this risk include sourcing our fuel from 
multiple regions and maintaining a reserve of fuel at our hub 
airports. The number of days of operations held in these reserves 
varies by airport, depending on the risk of extreme weather, the 
number of pipelines that serve the airport and other factors. We 
monitor closely the changing likelihood of severe weather and 
adjust these reserves accordingly.

Another strategy to mitigate this risk is our work to expand the 
commercial availability of SAF, which has the potential to further 
diversify fuel sources and supply.

Chronic The risk of longer-term 
changes in weather patterns

Sea-level rise in Miami, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and 
New York may require hardening of the airports in these 
locations, or even relocation.

Because high air temperatures reduce air density, chron-
ically high temperatures at some of our hub airports 
may require restricting the availability of seats for sale 
in certain markets, the use of aircraft with higher engine 
thrust and potentially reduced schedules. 

We recognize that we cannot halt sea-level rise on our own. Given 
the vulnerability of these key airports to flooding from sea-level 
rise, and the resulting impact to business continuity, we intend to 
investigate options to mitigate the impacts of sea-level rise, which 
may include fortifying the shoreline around those facilities and, as a 
last resort, considering options for relocation to areas further inland. 
The cost/benefit of available options may lead to adjustments to our 
network. We also plan to engage with policymakers to explore paths 
to greater resiliency. 

Over the next five years, we plan to incorporate the projected 
impacts of climate change into aircraft purchasing plans, routing 
and scheduling. We will also work with airframe and engine manu-
facturers to develop aircraft that meet the technical specifications 
required for operation at airports with sustained high temperatures.

Realization Strategy

Resource efficiency Reduce fuel costs by continuously modernizing our fleet with more 
efficient aircraft and operational improvements

We already have the youngest fleet among U.S. network carriers, and we 
are planning to continue our fleet modernization program in the coming 
years. We are pursuing measures to improve operational efficiency, 
including further strengthening our fuel conservation management and 
oversight. We will also continue to advocate with policymakers for reform 
of the nation’s air traffic control system, which has the potential to reduce 
GHG emissions from aviation.

Energy resources Shift to increasing shares of SAF, reducing exposure to the cost of 
growing carbon regulation and diversifying fuel supply

We have executed an offtake agreement with Neste, agreeing to purchase 
9 million gallons of SAF over three years beginning in 2020. We plan to 
continue to pursue opportunities to increase our use of SAF and advocate 
for policies that will increase SAF production capacity and improve its 
commercial viability.

Products and  
services

Attract travelers with a preference for low-carbon travel We have added a consumer-facing carbon offset option on our website 
and are exploring other opportunities to provide low-carbon offerings to 
our customers.

Markets Increase scheduled flights at our hubs that are at lower risk of adverse 
effects from climate change, such as Charlotte Douglas International 
Airport (CLT) and Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW)

CLT is American’s second-busiest hub and is geographically well-positioned 
to connect passengers domestically and internationally. Plans for the 
expansion and augmentation of current services will be considered. DFW 
is currently our largest hub, but there remains opportunity for growth.

Resilience Continue to expand our network of hubs and gateways across 
multiple sites with reduced climate risk, which we expect will in turn 
provide more connectivity for our customers

Our planned resilience program includes:

 • Conducting criticality and resilience assessments for operational 
procedures and existing infrastructure

 • Integrating the projected impacts of climate change into business 
continuity plans and emergency planning

 • Developing effective communication channels with airport staff and 
aviation stakeholders, including air navigation service providers, 
off-airport service providers, academia, communities and municipal 
authorities responsible for weather monitoring, climate analysis and 
disaster management

Climate-Related Risks and Opportunities (continued) Extreme Heat and Flight
One impact of climate change — which is already being felt across the southwestern part of the United 
States — will be more frequent heat waves and extreme temperature days. Rising temperatures will 
affect how people live and how industries operate, including airlines. 

Extreme heat affects aircraft in several ways. Hotter air is less dense than cooler air, meaning higher 
temperatures result in less lift and require more engine thrust for planes to take off. Hotter, thinner air 
also reduces engine output. While most aircraft can operate in very high temperatures (generally up 
to 126° F), doing so depends on a variety of factors — such as airport infrastructure and altitude — and 
requires making operational changes. And, smaller regional aircraft typically have lower maximum 
temperature thresholds. 

Constructing longer runways, which can accommodate the higher speeds needed to attain the altitude 
required by the flight path, is one way to enable planes to take off in hotter weather. A more immediate 
way is to reduce aircraft weight — thereby reducing the thrust required to take off — by limiting the 
number of passengers or the amount of cargo. On a typical American flight from Phoenix to New York,  
for example, we can fly with all the seats filled when it ’s 100° F. But if the temperature goes up to 110° F,  
the flight’s capacity goes down by six seats — and if it rises to 120° F, we may have to reduce our maximum 
capacity by as many as 35 seats. 

Increases in the number of hot days can cause heat buckling on runways and taxiways and other infra-
structure damage. And in extreme cases, it may become difficult to cool the aircraft to an acceptable 
temperature for customers and crew.

As part of our analysis of climate-related risks, we have identified which of our key sites face risks from 
increased temperatures and more frequent extreme heat events in the short, medium and long terms. 
And we are exploring strategies for mitigating those risks, such as making schedule changes to have 
more flights depart during cooler times of day at certain times of year and implementing new health and 
safety procedures for our team members.

Site-Level Analysis of Physical Risks

Our initial assessment indicates that our existing risk manage-
ment processes, including diversification of key assets and 
revenue streams and allocation of risk to third parties such 
as insurance companies — as well as ongoing due diligence 
related to changes in the likelihood of acute hazards — have 
been effective in avoiding material risk from the physical 
impacts of climate change. 

We will regularly evaluate and refine our risk management 
processes to ensure they remain effective as climate-related 
risks evolve and emerge. We will also continue to monitor 
and assess the key physical risks identified during our initial 
assessment, which include those noted in the table at right:

Governance and Management
The potential impacts of climate change span many aspects of 
American’s business. Day-to-day management of climate-related 
issues is embedded across our company — from our Airport Opera-
tions teams that do resiliency planning for more frequent and severe 
weather events, to our Fuel Procurement team working to secure 
cost-competitive supplies of sustainable aviation fuel.

As climate change has become a more pressing challenge for our 
company and our planet, we have taken steps to formalize and 
centralize coordination of how American manages climate-related 
issues. This includes reconsidering the way environmental, social 
and governance (ESG) matters — and climate change, in particular 
— are overseen by our Board of Directors to ensure we have robust 
governance of climate-related risks and opportunities. It also includes 
enhancing our management capacity to lead the development and 
execution of our long-term climate change strategy.

Board-Level Oversight
American’s Board of Directors oversees the company’s enterprisewide 
approach to risk management. Either as a full Board or through one 
or more of its committees, the Board reviews strategy and manage-
ment’s assessment of material risks affecting our business, including 
potential climate-related risks.

The Corporate Governance and Public Responsibility Committee 
has primary responsibility for oversight of American’s sustainability 
efforts. In 2020, the committee’s charter was updated to formally 
codify this role, including explicit reference to its oversight of 
climate-related risks and opportunities. The committee meets every 
quarter, and beginning in 2020, climate-related issues will be a 
standing agenda item for committee meetings and included in all 
quarterly updates. 

The full Board receives periodic updates on climate-related issues, most 
recently at its October 2019 meeting when it approved management’s 

plans to update and expand American’s sustainability strategy, with a 
focus on addressing climate-related risks and opportunities. 

Management Responsibility
Led by an Executive Vice President who reports directly to the CEO, 
American’s Corporate Affairs group has responsibility for managing 
and coordinating the company’s ESG efforts, including those related 
to sustainability and climate change. In 2019, we recruited a new 
Managing Director for ESG and reorganized the sustainability group  
under her leadership. This group was tasked with, among other respon-
sibilities, facilitating the enterprisewide climate risk assessment and 
scenario-planning process to inform our new climate strategy.

Our Sustainability Steering Committee — which is a cross- 
functional and cross-operational group of leaders from across 
our business — has responsibility for monitoring global trends, 
responding to stakeholder inquiries, offering recommendations to 
senior leadership and engaging with our Board on sustainability 
issues. Led by our Executive Vice President of Corporate Affairs, 
the group includes representatives from Airport Operations, Flight 
Operations, Technical Operations, Cargo, Finance, Safety, People and 
Communications, Legal, Government Affairs and Investor Relations.  
In 2020, this committee is focusing on identifying, assessing and 
making recommendations for addressing climate-related risks  
and opportunities.

Operating 
Safely

29

CEO Message Strategy Climate Team Members Customers TCFD/SASB DataSafety



At American Airlines, our first priority — and our foremost duty to our customers 
and our team members — is ensuring we operate every flight safely. Flight safety 
means protecting our customers and team members from the start through the  
end of a trip, from boarding passengers and loading baggage before departure  
to parking the aircraft on arrival and deplaning passengers and team members.

R
unning a safe and reliable operation is critical to our suc- 
cess, and we are proud to have safely transported more  
than 215 million customers on more than 2.3 million flights 
in 2019. Since our merger with US Airways at the end of 

2013, our team members have safely transported more than 1 billion 
passengers.

We are dedicated to fostering and sustaining a culture of safety 
that guides every decision we make. We have helped change the 
way the industry uses operational data and works with the Federal 
Aviation Administration (FAA) to identify and address risks. We have 
empowered every team member who touches our aircraft to take a 
plane out of service if there is a safety concern. And we have built 
a culture that encourages all team members and contractors to ask 
questions and report safety hazards, concerns and incidents without 
fear of reprisal.

Our best-in-class maintenance program meets or exceeds FAA and 
manufacturer requirements. In 2019, we had the largest maintenance 
team in the industry with 15,000 Technical Operations professionals, 
which includes more than 9,000 FAA-licensed aviation maintenance 
technicians and more than 100 FAA-awarded Master Mechanics. 
We are constantly improving our maintenance and safety processes 
through state-of-the-art data analysis.

We aim to improve our team member safety performance every  
year, but we have not met our own goals in this area. While we  
are deeply saddened to have experienced an employee fatality at  

one of our wholly owned regional carriers in 2019 (see p. 33), key 
safety metrics for our regional operations have improved since 
2017 — reflecting our continual efforts to strengthen our safety- and 
health-related policies, procedures and practices. In our mainline 
operations, several key metrics have worsened since 2017. In 2020, 
we are redoubling our efforts to keep our team members safe, and 
we are already seeing results. 

Our Goals

Maintain the highest passenger  
safety standards, with zero serious  

customer injuries 

Reduce on-the-job team

Safety Governance and  
Management
An uncompromising commitment to safety, security and continuous 
improvement is a shared responsibility — from our Board of Directors 
to frontline team members. 

Our Chief Executive Officer retains ultimate responsibility and 
authority for safety performance, and our Board of Directors receives 
monthly updates on key safety performance metrics. In July 2020, we 
updated the charter for the Board of Directors’ Corporate Governance 
and Public Responsibility Committee to include safety as one of its 
formal oversight responsibilities. That committee will review quarterly 
presentations from management on our safety performance and will 
also receive the same monthly updates that management receives. 

The safety of our customers and team members is guided by our 
Safety Management System (SMS), an organizationwide approach 
to managing risk and assuring the safety of our operations and team 
members. Our SMS emphasizes safety management as a funda-
mental business process to be considered in the same manner as 
other aspects of business management. It involves a full commitment 
from the most senior levels of our company through to each team 
member to integrate safety into all parts of how we do our jobs. Our 

SMS promotes a culture in which our team members proactively 
identify, analyze and mitigate risks throughout all aspects of our 
operations. The SMS ensures robust and repeatable processes driven 
by data to reduce risks and continuously improve and enhance safety 
for our customers and team members. We collaborate closely with the 
FAA to maintain operational safety at the highest level possible and 
actively share best practices with our industry peers, governments 
and aerospace manufacturers.

Safety Policy
Our Corporate Safety Policy applies to all team members, business 
partners, contractors and consultants, and it sets American’s safety 
objectives and standards and assigns responsibilities for safety 
across our organization. The policy also conveys management’s 

commitment to safety performance and to improving the level of 
safety through measurable goals and key performance indicators. 
Part of our SMS foundation, the policy helps to create a culture that 
encourages effective management of risk along with continuous 
improvement. The Safety Policy complies with all applicable regula-
tory requirements and laws in the countries in which we operate  
and establishes standards for acceptable operational behaviors. 

Safety Assurance
The Safety Assurance component of our SMS outlines how we use 
data collection and conduct quality assurance and internal oversight 
to validate the effectiveness of risk controls and the performance of 
the SMS. Through the Safety Assurance component, we verify that 
risk controls in our operational processes continue to conform to the

requirements for which they are intended and that they remain effective 
at maintaining risks at acceptable levels.

Aviation Safety Action Program 

We proactively mitigate any risks to team members before those risks 
can cause injury. In a large organization like ours, one challenge in 
countering potential hazards is that the individuals who can implement 
positive change cannot be the eyes and ears for the whole system. 
We therefore rely on the Aviation Safety Action Program (ASAP), an 
industry tool that encourages voluntary reporting of safety events or 
discrepancies, which are then reviewed jointly by management, the 
relevant union and the FAA. The goal of ASAP is to prevent accidents 
and incidents by encouraging frontline team members and airlines 
to report safety information that can identify safety risks, rather than 
letting such incidents go undocumented. American was the first airline 
to create an ASAP program; they have since been adopted by more 
than 250 carriers worldwide. 

In 2019, American recorded 11,952 ASAP reports, up from 10,924 
in 2018. We view an increase in ASAP reports as a positive trend 
because it gives us more opportunities to identify and resolve 
potential safety issues and signals that team members are comfort-
able raising safety concerns when they see them. Currently, we have 
ASAPs for Flight, Flight Service, Dispatch, Technical Operations 
and Central Load Planning. To enhance our safety performance and 
culture, we are expanding safety reporting with a new Ground Safety 
Action Program (GSAP). This will enable full reporting for ramp 
employees. We created GSAP by collaborating with the Transport 
Workers Union of America–International Association of Machinists & 
Aerospace Workers (TWU–IAM) and the FAA. The ASAP and GSAP 
programs will be able to share information that cuts across multiple 
workgroups. This allows for comprehensive reporting and actions 
to address safety risks across all of our operations. All programs will 
use event review committees composed of representatives from the 
company, the relevant union and the FAA.

Flight Operations Quality Assurance

Flight Operations Quality Assurance is a voluntary safety program 
administered jointly by American and the Allied Pilots Association 
(APA) that uses routinely recorded flight data to proactively identify 
and correct deficiencies in flight operations. Through this program, we 
routinely monitor approximately 90% of our flights, using algorithms 
that sift through each flight’s data looking for potential safety events. 
We use the results to understand pilot performance and to monitor 
aircraft systems, performance and operational efficiency. 

IOSA Audit

As part of our commitment to transparency and monitoring, we are a 
registered participant in the International Air Transport Association’s 
Operational Safety Audit (IOSA) program, an internationally recog-
nized evaluation system designed to assess an airline’s operational 
management and control systems. The IOSA audit, which takes place 
every two years, creates a structured methodology with standardized 
checklists that are comparable on a worldwide basis, enabling and 
maximizing the joint use of audit reports. 

Safety Risk Management
The Safety Risk Management (SRM) element of our SMS provides a 
decision-making process for identifying hazards and mitigating risk 
based on a thorough understanding of our systems and their operating 
environment. SRM enables us to consider the risks in our operations 
and reduce them to an acceptable level. We use the SRM process 
whenever there is a significant change to our operations, such as 
delivery of a new type of aircraft or the addition of a new airport to 
our network. We also apply SRM when our Safety Assurance process 
identifies a new hazard or the ineffective control of an existing hazard.

We use several tools to identify hazards and evaluate the need for 
new or revised risk controls. The process of risk management is the 
same regardless of the trigger or event, and our SMS looks at multiple 
factors for risk. While the FAA requirements are geared toward flight 

safety, our SMS goes further to evaluate a wider range of global risks, 
including operational disruptions. 

Safety Promotion
Safety culture is the foundation of any SMS, with trust at the core. At 
American, we believe in a Just Culture approach, which encourages 
each team member to take responsibility and accountability for 
achieving the highest safety standards and results. This approach, 
which we have championed for more than a decade and has since 
become an accepted aviation industry standard, encourages team 
members to report errors, risky decisions or omissions without fear of 
punitive actions (although a clear line differentiates between accept-
able and unacceptable behaviors). We train our teams to look at 
potential safety events using three types of behaviors: human errors, 
at-risk behavior and reckless behavior. 

Responding to Emergencies
Our Emergency Response Manual (ERM), which establishes effective 
and efficient response practices for various types of emergencies, is an 
integral part of our SMS program. The ERM serves as the governing 
document for the entire American Airlines Corporate Emergency 
Response Plan and details guidelines to prepare for and respond to 
emergencies, responsibilities for team members across our organi-
zation, protocols for communicating with both internal and external 
stakeholders and mechanisms for stakeholders to report emergencies.

The ERM includes a detailed Pandemic Preparedness and Response 
Plan, which we put into action once the severity of the COVID-19 
pandemic became clear. The pandemic response plan provides 
uniform policies and procedures for protecting our team members 
and customers and facilitates coordination among our Chief Medical 
Officer, our pandemic committee and regulatory agencies. American’s 
corporate response is guided by the World Health Organization’s 
Pandemic Level ratings, in addition to information from the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention. (See p. 35 for more on our 
response to COVID-19.)

Team Member Safety
Maintaining a safe workplace for every one of our team members is 
a cornerstone of American’s safety program, and we aim to reduce 
our employee injury rate every year. Although our regional operations 
have improved over the last three years, we have experienced a 
disappointing increase in injuries across our mainline operations 
during this same period.

In 2019, we were deeply saddened to experience an employee fatality 
— a valued member of our ground support crew in our regional 
operations. We can — and must — do better, and we have therefore 
increased safety oversight at the highest levels of our company and 
put into place new initiatives and structures designed to improve 
safety throughout our operations. (See p. 31 for information on 
Board of Director oversight.) 

In August, a ramp agent was killed during an accident at Charlotte 
Douglas International Airport. Described as a hard worker and dedicated 
team member, he was passionate about people and airplanes. He was 
also known for shining a positive light in any situation. Our wholly owned 
regional carrier, Piedmont, continues to investigate the root cause of 
the accident and implement risk controls while working with the U.S. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) to ensure the 
safest environment for our team members and customers.

Our senior leadership team, including our Chief Executive Officer 
and our company President, receive monthly updates on team 
member safety. These updates are provided as part of our SMS. 
(See more on p. 31.) 

Across our organization, we focus on injury reduction, evaluate trends 
and develop programs to enhance safety. We have been centralizing 
our data collection and injury reporting tools to provide better visibility 
and access to company leaders. In addition to monitoring injury 
rates, we closely track aircraft ground damage because it is strongly 
correlated with on-the-job injuries. 

We have developed a strong culture of injury reporting, and team 
members are urged to report all injuries — including those that do not 
require medical attention — because having the most comprehensive 
view possible into potential injury risks is critical to finding ways to 
reduce them. 

Among all team member groups, our ramp agents have the highest 
rate of injuries, primarily as the result of lifting baggage, often 
in awkward and tight spaces. We recently conducted a training 
program on proper lifting techniques and hired on-site athletic 
trainers at our busiest airport hubs to work with ramp agents on 
body mechanics and fitness. Our flight attendant group has the 
second highest rate of injuries, followed by aircraft mechanics. To 
address flight attendant injuries during flight, we established a 
Turbulence Task Force to provide policies, procedures and capabil-
ities to reduce team member and passenger injuries and improve 
the flight experience. Through this group, we have revised our 
turbulence avoidance and event procedures, strengthened our seat 
belt policy, and improved our technology to provide our pilots with 
real-time turbulence avoidance information.

To reduce head and scalp injuries among mechanics, we introduced a 
new bump cap, which is a hat with a hard plastic insert — worn when 
hard hats are not required — that helps protect against injuries. Our 
mechanics told us that they wanted a lighter cap with a shorter bill 

that would be less hot to wear and give them greater visibility. We 
tested prototypes of the new caps at locations with high head/scalp 
injury rates and, based on the feedback we received, rolled out two 
new bump caps to our entire team in 2019.

We also recently developed a program for team members who suffer 
repeated on-the-job injuries. The initiative will evaluate whether 
these team members are working unsafely — and therefore need 
trainings and tools to change their work behaviors — or if their initial 
injuries made them more susceptible to repeated injuries. 

Partnering with Our Unions
We work with our unions on an ongoing basis to identify safety 
concerns and new ways to improve our safety performance. The 
ASAP process described on p. 32 is the result of cooperation 
between airlines and their union partners. Such cooperation 
is integral to our entire safety program. Over the course of 10 
months in 2019–2020, for example, we teamed up with union 
leaders from the TWU–IAM and the APA to evaluate safety risks 
at the gate at our 14 largest airports and to develop mitigation 
plans for each identified risk. This exercise resulted in a number 
of findings, all of which are being addressed now. 

Importantly, our unions have been instrumental in developing 
and communicating new team member safety measures enacted 
because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Learn more on p. 35.

The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our world, our industry and 
our company to an extraordinary and unprecedented extent, upending 
business as usual across every sector of society and devastating 
families and communities with immeasurable pain and loss. 

Since the start of the crisis, our foremost priorities have been the 
health and well-being of our customers and team members and, 
notwithstanding the impact of the virus on customer demand, the 
continued ability of American to deliver access to needed air service 
across our nation and provide livelihoods for our team members.

Travel with Confidence
COVID-19 has forced us to rethink how we deliver our services, to 
keep customers and team members healthy and to provide peace of 
mind during air travel.

Throughout the pandemic, we have worked closely with the Centers 
for Disease Control and Prevention and a range of outside experts to 
understand the latest developments and determine the adaptations 
necessary for our operations. In June 2020, we announced our new 
Travel Health Advisory Panel, which is providing us with advice and 
guidance on disease prevention, cleaning procedures and other 
public health matters. This panel complements our internal COVID-19 
working group of experts from across our business, including our 
medical director; this group meets regularly to review the latest 
guidance from health officials and coordinate our response. 

The high-efficiency particulate air (HEPA) filtration system on board our 
entire mainline fleet — and most regional jets — provides a complete 
air change every two to four minutes. HEPA technology is similar to the 
standards for hospitals, helping keep environments clear of bacteria and 
viruses while providing clean air.

In addition, we have put in place a multilayered and ever-evolving ap-
proach to protect the health of customers and team members, including:

 • Requiring face coverings for customers throughout their entire 
journey — and denying boarding or future travel for customers 
who refuse to comply7

 • Making the wearing of a face covering an essential function of 
our team members’ jobs, requiring them while at work

 • Enhancing cleaning procedures on our aircraft, in our airports 
and at our facilities

 • Installing plexiglass shields at ticket counters and boarding gates

 • Deploying touchless check-in at airports, including printing 
baggage tags at kiosks

 • Modifying onboard food and beverage service to minimize contact

 • Asking customers during check-in to certify that they have been 
free of COVID-19 symptoms for the past 14 days

 • Instituting temperature checks for team members at major 
locations across the system

 • Offering preflight COVID-19 testing for customers traveling to 
international destinations, starting with Jamaica and the Bahamas, 
with plans to expand the program to additional markets

These are just some of the important safety measures we are taking. 

Our Clean Commitment

The American Airlines Clean Commitment is our promise that we’re 
taking bold measures and using the latest products and technology to 
help ensure the well-being of our customers when they travel with us 
and the well-being of our team members as they provide this service. We 
have expanded our already comprehensive efforts to clean our aircraft 
and airports, enhancing procedures on all flights and developing new 
disinfection protocols for catering equipment and supplies. 

In late August, we became the first airline to announce plans to upgrade 
to SurfaceWise2, a breakthrough electrostatic spraying solution from 
Allied BioScience. The SurfaceWise2 solution is the first long-lasting 

7.  American Airlines requires all customers over the age of 2 to wear face coverings at airports and 
on board. The only time face coverings may be removed at the airport or on board is when the 
customer is eating or drinking.

Responding to COVID-19

information on our response to COVID-19 
and what we are doing to keep our cus-
tomers and team members safe.

product approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to help 
fight the spread of COVID-19. SurfaceWise2 creates an invisible barrier 
on surfaces, which physically breaks down and kills virus cells, helping to 
protect passengers and team members against COVID-19 transmission 
via surfaces, particularly on high-touch areas such as seats, armrests, tray 
tables and overhead bin doors.

We also were the first airline to begin working with the Global Biorisk 
Advisory Council (GBAC) for STARTM accreditation for our fleet and 
customer lounges. GBAC STAR accreditation demonstrates that 
proper cleaning and disinfection practices, procedures and systems 
are in place to prepare for, respond to and recover from pandemics. 
We expect to receive full accreditation by the end of 2020 for our 
entire fleet and all lounges. GBAC is a division of ISSA, the worldwide 
cleaning industry association.

The combination of required face coverings, thorough cleaning 
protocols, HEPA filters and the use of SurfaceWise2 will help make 
the travel experience even safer for team members and customers 
who are ready to return to the skies.

Taking Care of Our Team Members

To take good care of our customers, we must take good care of our 
team. The extensive safety measures we have enacted in response 
to COVID-19 are designed to protect customers and team members.

All team members must wear face coverings when indoors and on 
aircraft. Face coverings are also required when working outdoors, 
except in extreme heat. 

To help ensure a safe work environment for everyone, mainline 
team members are required to complete a short self-declaration 
called “Well for Work” at least every 31 days. This self-declaration 
is designed to reduce the spread of COVID-19 by asking team 
members to monitor their health daily for any new, unusual or 
worsening COVID-19 symptoms and to take appropriate safety 
precautions when necessary. And at many of our locations, we’re 

checking team members’ temperatures when they enter their work 
location. Those who record a temperature above the limit set by 
the CDC or applicable government order are sent home. We’ve also 
made COVID-19 testing more accessible for team members.

Team members are eligible for two weeks of paid leave if they are 
awaiting test results, have received a confirmed diagnosis, or have 
been ordered quarantined by a physician or public health official 
because of exposure. 

We also have been offering voluntary and extended leave options for 
team members who do not feel comfortable going to work or who 
need the flexibility to care for children or other family members. All of 
our voluntary leave programs come with continued health benefits 
and continued company match to 401(k) and other contractual 
pension programs. As we adjust our business to the lower demand 
levels for air travel in a pandemic, we are doing everything we can 
to support our team members whose positions have been cut. Learn 
more on p. 45.

Offering Flexibility for Customers

Flexibility is one way to improve peace of mind in today’s travel envi-
ronment. We recently announced we are eliminating change fees for all  
domestic and short-haul international flights on Premium Cabin fares 
and most Main Cabin fares for tickets purchased October 1, 2020, and 
beyond. We’re also giving customers the ability to fly standby for free 
on earlier flights to the same destination on the same day, and we’re 
providing access to upgrades and seats for all fare types.

Our aim is to make travel easier and less complicated for customers, 
giving them more flexibility when they travel on American.

During 2020, we also began notifying customers whose flights may 
be full, allowing them to move at no cost to more open flights. If space 
is available on the aircraft once boarding is complete — considering 
any aircraft weight or balance restrictions — customers may move to 
another seat within their ticketed cabin.

Supporting Our Communities
When COVID-19 struck, American quickly mobilized to address  
critical needs in communities across our nation that were affected  
by the pandemic. To ensure the world’s goods continued to get 
where they needed to go, we used aircraft otherwise grounded to 
fly cargo flights carrying life-saving pharmaceuticals and medical 
supplies, as well as fresh produce, electronics and manufacturing 
parts, to keep the global supply chain moving. As of September 
2020, we had operated 2,500 cargo-only flights to transport these 
critical goods and supplies around the globe.

As of August 2020, we had contributed more than 1 million pounds 
of food from our inventory to food banks across the country — the 
result of excess supplies given our reduced flying schedule. We 
provided thousands of care packages to military bases for troops 
quarantined after returning from deployment and donated supply 
kits to hospitals in major U.S. cities. In cooperation with our 
generous customers, we raised more than $3 million to support 
the American Red Cross and its volunteers. And, team members at 
multiple locations sewed masks for their coworkers and members 
of the community.

In May 2020, American and Hyatt awarded more than 4,000 health 
care professionals — from doctors, physician assistants and 
nurses to facilities and food service teams — at a hard-hit New 
York City hospital with three-night complimentary vacations, in 
recognition of the extraordinary care these individuals provide to 
the community. We also have awarded hundreds of thousands of 
air miles points to small businesses and nonprofit organizations 
needing travel support.

Our team members are our most important asset — and we believe that if we create 
an environment where they feel supported, they will take good care of our customers. 
To do this, we must continue to build a diverse and inclusive environment, helping all 
team members reach their full potential and providing them with health and wellness 
support. This philosophy has long guided our company and is even more important 
as we navigate the COVID-19 pandemic. 

F
or our company to emerge from this crisis on sound footing 
and return to profitability, we must become a smaller airline  
in the near term — and that means taking steps to adjust  
our staffing to reflect the current demand environment. See  

p. 45 for a discussion of how we are going about this.

Even amid one of the most difficult periods in our company’s history, 
we recognize that our country is facing another significant challenge: 
the systemic racism that for far too long has harmed Black Americans 
and other Americans of color. We remain committed to fostering a 
more diverse, equitable and inclusive workplace that helps all of our 
team members build successful and rewarding careers. We also 
recognize that we must do more to use our corporate voice to help 
eliminate systemic racism in America.

Diversity, Equity and Inclusion 
Cultivating an environment that celebrates diversity, equity and 
inclusion is a top priority at American, and we seek to create 
a workplace where diverse perspectives and experiences are 
welcomed and encouraged, where team members feel comfortable  
to be their authentic selves and where we are always learning  
from one another.

We have heard from team members and customers that we need 
to improve in this area. In response, we established the role of Chief 

Our Goals

concerns and address those concerns in our 
learning, development, advancement and 
recruitment programs and processes

implicit bias to generate further education and 
awareness of diversity and inclusion issues

Launch an external Community Council

Inclusion and Diversity Officer; created an Office of Diversity, Equity 
and Inclusion (DEI); and moved DEI into our talent function so we 
can view all hiring and development through the lens of equity and 
inclusion. We also formed a Team Member Experience organization  
to review any concerns from team members. We created an industry- 
leading implicit bias training program — delivering it to approximately 
105,000 team members as of March 2020 — and formed a specialized 
Customer Relations team to listen to, resolve and learn from customer 
complaints of discrimination (learn more on p. 50).

Recent events in the United States — which have highlighted the 
pervasive and far-reaching impacts of systemic racism — have 
prompted us to think even more deeply about how we can do more 
within our company to advance diversity, equity and inclusion, as  
well as use our corporate voice to be a positive force for change.

Deepening Our Commitment to  
Our Black Colleagues and Customers
The widespread protests for racial justice in 2020 in response to the 
violence and social injustices faced by Black people in the United 
States underscore the urgent need for systemic change. It also under-
scores the work we must do within our own company to strengthen 
our existing DEI efforts and address the needs of our Black team 
members and customers. 

In the weeks following the first demonstrations, we spoke openly 
with our Black team members, leading to important suggestions 
and recommendations focused on relationship building, continued 
learning and intentional recruitment and advancement. These 
conversations are ongoing.

We are establishing a Community Council, sponsored by American 
Airlines President Robert Isom and composed of senior company  
executives and a cross-section of Black community leaders. The  
council will provide feedback on company initiatives, focusing on  
issues affecting the customer travel experience. We will look to the 
external members of the council for their perspectives on the chal-

lenges our Black customers face. In addition, we are hosting numerous 
gatherings and listening sessions about race with our team members. 

We recognize that the representation of Black professionals in our 
senior leadership is insufficient. We are redoubling our commitment 
to diversifying our leadership team. We will establish specific objec-
tives and lay out a plan to achieve them, including by enhancing our 
recruiting, development and mentorship programs.

We also pledge to assist Black youth in developing job skills and 

expanding access to well-paying careers as part of our overall 
strategy to increase opportunities in Dallas/Fort Worth, in our nine 
other hub cities and in Tulsa, Oklahoma, where our maintenance 
facility is based. As we return to growing our airline and hiring again, 
we will do all we can to ensure that young people in historically 
underserved communities have opportunities to join our team.

Creating an Inclusive Workplace for  
All of Our Team Members
We know the importance of creating an inclusive workplace for 
current and future team members, and we are redoubling our 
commitment to supporting a culture in which everyone is valued  

and respected. Any incident of conscious or unconscious bias toward 
our customers or team members is unacceptable and will be addressed 
appropriately. Each one of us is accountable for ensuring that our 
actions and those of our fellow team members support a culture of 
inclusion and respect.

To create a truly diverse workplace — one that provides every person 
with equal opportunities — we must fight unconscious bias. We 
require all team members to participate in a leading, multipronged 
implicit bias training program, which examines ways to recognize and 
mitigate implicit bias and establishes cultural expectations. Launched 
in 2018, the training uses the PAUSE model developed by Howard 
Ross, a leader in creating inclusive leadership and cultures. 

The program includes workplace-specific scenarios that enable 
participants to understand how implicit bias may manifest itself at 
American. More than 105,000 team members completed both the 
in-person and online components of the training as of March 2020. 
Even in our constrained budgetary environment, we committed to 
implementing the second phase of the program in 2020 and beyond 
through online and in-person training.

One of the other important ways we cultivate support is through 
our Employee Business Resource Groups, which are dedicated to 
promoting cultural enrichment, supporting business success and 
engaging team members in community service. 

To create a supportive and inclusive environment, we must have 
policies that make clear how we expect our team members to act, 
uphold our values and treat one another. We are updating our policies 
— including our social media policies — to provide clear guidance 
on conduct and consequences for discriminatory and racially biased 
behavior in the workplace and online. The policies will provide guidance 
on consequences for customers who are verbally abusive or use 
discriminatory language while traveling with us.

Listening Sessions
At American, we aim to translate the energy and awareness 
sparked by Black Lives Matter protests into meaningful change. 
But to help create a more inclusive culture, our leaders must first 
listen and learn from the experiences of our Black team members.

Between June and September, company leaders hosted nearly 
40 listening sessions involving more than 1,200 team members 
across our network. Additionally, senior executives visited our 
hubs in Philadelphia and Charlotte to better understand the 
experiences of our Black team members and learn what we  
can do to make our company stronger and more inclusive.

In Philadelphia — our hub with the highest concentration of 
Black team members — President Robert Isom and other senior 
leaders heard the need for greater representation at the executive 
level and for a more equitable process for career advancement. 
In Charlotte, team members expressed the desire for improved 
management trust and support.

Following the listening sessions, participants were asked about 
their hopes and how American can use the stories shared during 
the sessions to create a more inclusive environment for team 
members and customers. Only through continued dialogue can 
we break down barriers, improve our shared understanding and 
build a better company.

Anti-Racism Learning Pathway
Engagement, advocacy and solidarity with our Black team 
members and customers are more essential than ever. In July, 
we rolled out an anti-racism learning pathway through Degreed, 
our online learning platform, which is available to all of our team 
members. Being an ally requires education and action. The path-
way offers a collection of articles, books, movies and podcasts 
about bias and what team members can do to combat it.

“ The first thing we need to do as busi-
ness leaders is to get our own houses  
in order. It’s incumbent upon the  
business sector to make social justice 
a collective priority and to lobby for 
change, which will require legislation 
and community action on things like 
criminal justice, education and eco-
nomic equality. That’s going to require 
sustained engagement and support — 
and we at American are looking  
forward to tackling this aggressively.”

— Doug Parker, Chairman and CEO

Recruiting and Developing Diverse Talent
We have been working to build a strong and diverse pipeline of talent 
through multiple community partnerships dedicated to encouraging 
and mentoring people of color and women who are traditionally 
underrepresented in the aviation and aerospace industries. We also 
partner with Historically Black Colleges and Universities and Hispanic 
Serving Institutions.

To develop and retain Black leadership talent, we are piloting a 
sponsorship program to foster relationship-building opportunities 
for our Black directors and managing directors. Applicants to this 

program, which is voluntary, will be matched with a member of the 
senior team or one of our senior vice presidents. The objectives of the 
program are to enable Black leaders to benefit from the perspective 
and experience of senior leaders; give senior leaders exposure to 
issues Black professionals experience in their day-to-day work lives 
that these leaders may not have encountered personally; and nurture 
mutual understanding that will help facilitate the advancement of 
greater numbers of Black professionals into senior leadership roles in 
our company. As of August 2020, we are testing this approach with a 
small group of Black leaders and will refine it as we receive feedback 
from participants.

Fighting for LGBTQ Inclusion  
and Equality
American has been a longtime leader and ally in the struggle 
for equal rights and protections for our lesbian, gay, bisexual, 
transgender and queer (LGBTQ) team members, customers and 
community members. We offer medical coverage to same-sex 
domestic partners and provide benefits for gender reassignment 
coverage. And we were the first major U.S. airline to protect 
LGBTQ team members by including gender identity and sexual 
orientation in workplace nondiscrimination policies. 

In 2019, we joined an amicus brief supporting LGBTQ workplace 
protections under the Civil Rights Act, which the U.S. Supreme 
Court upheld in 2020. And in 2020, we joined an amicus brief 
supporting the application of nondiscrimination laws in the public 
sphere to protect the rights of same-sex couples, in Fulton vs. 
The City of Philadelphia. We also have been advocating for the 
passage of hate crime laws in states where we conduct business. 
While federal laws exist to penalize hate crimes, we believe every 
state should affirm that crimes committed as acts of hate have 
no place in any community in our country. American supported 
the successful effort to enact a hate crimes law in Georgia, and 
we have joined with other companies to urge the states of South 
Carolina and Wyoming to pass similar legislation.

In late 2019, we began offering a nonbinary gender option during 
the booking process. To implement that enhancement, we are 
training team members to help raise awareness and sensitivity 
about issues facing our nonbinary colleagues and customers.  
The training offers tips and potential language alternatives, such 
as using “they/them” or names in place of gendered pronouns.

Talent Development
We give our team members the tools, training and resources they 
need to do their best work and stay true to our purpose — caring 
for people on life’s journey. In the years since our merger with US 
Airways, we have created a suite of programs aimed at helping our 
people develop the skills and experience to succeed in their roles  
and build rewarding, long-term careers within our company.

The COVID-19 pandemic has forced us to make difficult decisions 
as we adjust to the new reality. Even though we have had to reduce 
our workforce (see p. 45), we must continue to invest in our people 
to develop and retain the talent we need to succeed in a highly 
competitive and fast-changing industry.

In 2019, we began analyzing the skills that our team members had, 
identifying where there were gaps in connection with our business 
needs and determining how we could help team members build these 
skills we lacked. As part of this process, we partnered with a leading 
online skills development platform called Degreed, which connects 
team members to millions of courses, videos, articles, books, podcasts 
and experts from thousands of internal and external sources. In 2019, 
more than 5,000 team members piloted the platform, which has since 
been made available to all team members to develop their profes-
sional and personal skills on their own time and at their own pace.

Degreed lets team members take charge of their professional develop-
ment, helping them assess and advance their skills, making them more 
versatile for their current roles and preparing them for new positions. 
The platform also helps us better understand what skills our team 
members have so we can align the right talent with the right roles in  
the company.

When it became clear that COVID-19 would have a tremendous 
impact on our company — and recognizing the need to continue to 
invest in our team — we moved quickly to an all-digital professional 
development platform to facilitate on-demand access for our team 

members. As of July 31, 2020, more than 12,000 team members had 
accessed Degreed and consumed more than 670,000 pieces of 
learning content.

We also have a partnership with Harvard Business School Publishing to 
provide mainline team members with access to Harvard ManageMentor 
(HMM). One of the most trusted, on-demand professional development 
resources, HMM covers 41 essential business topics — everything from 
managing change to leading people to handling difficult interactions. 
Each topic features a collection of concise lessons, videos and tools 
for fast and effective learning. We also mapped the HMM topics to our 
company’s leadership attributes and strategic objectives to help our 
team members understand how their own development can align with 
what’s important at American.

By offering robust development opportunities, we’re building a more 
engaged and flexible team while strengthening our overall business.

Comprehensive Benefits
We work to provide comprehensive benefits that support the physical, 
emotional and financial well-being of our team members so they can 
live their best lives and enjoy a healthy work-life balance.

Medical coverage. We’re committed to providing medical coverage 
that’s both affordable and flexible. At our headquarters and largest 
hub in Dallas/Fort Worth, we recently launched a new health care 
option called DFW ConnectedCare, which offers lower monthly 
premiums and reduced copays through a direct relationship with an 
accountable care organization affiliated with Baylor Scott & White 
Health. This plan is available to approximately 25,000 team members.

Health care navigation and support. To help team members 
manage and understand their health and well-being benefits, we have 
partnered with Accolade, an independent health benefits navigator. 
Accolade’s personal health assistants help U.S.-based mainline team 
members navigate the health care system and take full advantage 
of their insurance coverage, so they can make the most of all the 
health-related programs and resources American offers. As of July 
2020, more than 40% of unique eligible families had taken advantage 
of this service — an increase from last year — demonstrating the value 
of this program to team members. A similar service is available for 
team members enrolled in DFW ConnectedCare. 

Among the health care resources available for team members are 
telemedicine and discount prescription services. Thousands of team 
members have taken advantage of Doctor On Demand, which offers 
physician consultations via telemedicine 24 hours a day, seven days a 
week. For our round-the-clock workforce, this service offers conve-
nient care when team members need it most. In addition, StayWell 
Rx supports team members with high blood pressure, diabetes and 
asthma by providing discounted medications and supplies. 

Well-being resources. Our new well-being program, Journey to 
Well-Being, launched in 2020 to help all U.S.-based mainline team 

members — and their covered dependents age 18 and older — make 
lasting changes in four key areas of well-being: physical, emotional, 
financial and work. Activities include biometric screenings, online 
well-being assessments, daily step tracking, developing financial 
plans and more. Human performance coaching and stress resilience 
training are also part of the Journey to Well-Being offerings. 

To help further support our team members during the COVID-19 
pandemic, we launched free access to online fitness courses, 
including both live-streamed sessions and 1,000 video-on-demand 
workouts. We also began offering two new digital resources to help 
users reduce anxiety and stress and improve their sleep habits. 

Financial wellness resources. In addition to the financial well-
being track in the Journey to Well-Being platform, this year we 
launched two new tools from Fidelity to support team members in 
their financial planning efforts. The first is the Financial Wellness 
Checkup, a financial wellness portal that addresses broad financial 
needs all in one place. The Financial Wellness Checkup offers a 
score across four key categories — budgeting, debt management, 
savings and protection — so team members know where they stand 
financially at any given point in time.

Second, we updated our Fidelity NetBenefits home page to allow 
those with an American Airlines pension to see their pension benefit 
next to their 401(k) balance. The estimated monthly pension benefit  
is also integrated into Fidelity’s retirement planning software. 

COVID-19 testing. American worked with local health care providers 
in 10 metropolitan areas to make priority COVID-19 testing available to 
covered U.S.-based mainline team members and, in some cases, their 
dependents. For example, we performed more than 1,000 diagnostic 
tests at our headquarters in Dallas/Fort Worth. Nationwide, team 
members were able to be screened for COVID-19 via telemedicine  
as well as receive referrals to local testing sites for both diagnostic 
and antibody testing.

(See p. 36 to learn about the pandemic-related leave benefits we 
have offered.)

Other benefits include the following:

 • Up to 10 weeks of paid leave through our maternity disability plan

 • Up to $4,000 in financial support for adoption-related expenses

 • Optum Employee Assistance Program (EAP) to provide coun-
seling services for team members and their households; on-site 
support is available at 10 locations 

 • Optum WorkLife Services to help team members find resources 
for child care, elder care, home repairs, legal services and other 
solutions to assist with everyday challenges

Appreciating Team Members
Our internal recognition programs give team members and 
customers the opportunity to show their appreciation for a 
job well done. In 2019, our team members were recognized by 
customers, peers and company leaders more than 2.5 million 
times. Last year, American launched a new Nonstop Thanks 
program through which team members award each other points 
for stellar work or as an expression of gratitude. Those points  
can be redeemed for items in an online catalog. 

Every quarter, hundreds of team members are nominated for  
the Chairman’s Award, the highest honor that American bestows 
upon team members. The 365 quarterly winners honored in 2019 
each received $2,500 and were eligible to be named one of the 
100 Annual Chairman’s recipients, who are awarded $10,000.

Labor Relations
American respects our team members’ rights to free association and 
collective bargaining, and we strive to work collaboratively with our 
union partners to negotiate industry-leading contracts. Approximately 
85% of our workforce is represented by labor unions8 — the highest 
percentage of represented workers of any U.S. airline. 

Since 2005, we have completed more than 30 collective bargaining 
agreements, significantly more than any other airline. Our goal is to 
offer industry-leading total compensation and benefits packages, 
including profit sharing, to all of our team members. Following 
the merger of American and US Airways in 2013, we completed 
joint collective bargaining agreements combining our workforces 
in a record period of time, with the exception of one agreement. 
These agreements increased average pay for our represented team 
members by 63%.

In the first quarter of 2020, we reached an agreement with the 
Transport Workers Union–International Association of Machinists 
(TWU–IAM) Association on a new, five-year contract for our 
maintenance and fleet service team members.

During the COVID-19 crisis, we have worked with our union leaders to 
develop voluntary leave and early out programs to prioritize the most 
immediate needs of our team members. We also continue to work in 
partnership with our unions to protect jobs and the important role our 
industry will play in the recovery from the pandemic.

Creating an Airline to Fit the New Reality
The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted our world, our industry and 
the company to an extraordinary and unprecedented extent. Since 
the start of the crisis, we have focused on our continued ability to 
provide livelihoods for our team members and maintain as much 
air service as possible, notwithstanding the impact of COVID-19 on 
demand. We know that we must be prepared to expand capacity 
quickly and efficiently when the crisis subsides and help lead the 
economy back to stability and growth.

To support these goals, we joined with union leaders and other 
airlines in a joint request to federal government leaders for financial 
support to stabilize the passenger airline industry and protect its 
outstanding workforce. In March, Congress and the Administration 
responded with the Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security 
(CARES) Act, an economic stabilization package to help U.S. workers 
and businesses devastated by the drastic economic downturn. The 
Payroll Support Program (PSP) of the CARES Act allowed us to keep 
our frontline workforce in place through the first phase of the crisis, 
providing us with approximately $5.8 billion to be used exclusively 
for the continued payment of team member wages, salaries and 
benefits. By providing airlines with the funds to pay much of our 
team members’ salaries and benefits, the CARES Act ensured that 
the commercial airline industry kept serving customers who needed 
to fly, kept providing vital air service to U.S. communities and kept 
our country moving in the midst of economic turmoil. 

When we do emerge from the COVID-19 crisis, we know that we will 
need to be a smaller airline for at least a period of time. We have 
reduced operating expenses, in part through voluntary leave and 
early out programs. Across our mainline and wholly owned regional 
carriers, more than 12,500 of our colleagues have made the difficult 
decision to leave the company permanently through early out 
programs or retirement. Another 11,000 team members have offered 

to take leaves of absence. We have also reduced our management 
and support staff (MSS) team by about 30% to reach the size of the 
team we will need for a smaller airline moving forward. The MSS team 
members who were involuntarily separated earlier this year remained 
on payroll and received full benefits through September 30, 2020, 
consistent with the CARES Act.

From the start of the crisis, we set a goal for ourselves to properly 
size our frontline team for the future without having to implement 
involuntary furloughs. The PSP worked as intended to protect our 
team against involuntary separations for the six months that ended 
on September 30. But the virus has outlasted our assumptions about 
when demand for air travel would return. Based on current demand 
levels, we expect to fly less than 50% of our airline in the fourth 
quarter, with long-haul international capacity reduced to only 25% 
of 2019 levels. At the time of publication of this report — and despite 
enormous bipartisan support for an extension of the PSP — Congress 
had not yet extended the program, and we had begun the difficult 
process of furloughing 19,000 of our hardworking and dedicated 
colleagues. However, if efforts to extend the PSP are successful in 
the near term, we will reverse our furlough processes and recall any 
impacted team members.

This has been a painful time for all of us at our company, but 
especially for our departing colleagues who gave American their  
all and left through no fault of their own. They deserve our respect 
and gratitude — and we owe them a commitment to return American 
to profitability and growth as quickly as possible.

Human Rights
Our business is all about people — connecting people, cultures and 
commerce worldwide. Respect for human rights is embedded in all 
aspects of our business and in all geographies where we operate.

Our core values include integrity, respect for the individual and the 
unique customs and cultures in the communities where we operate, 
respect for human rights as embodied in the principles of the  
United Nations (U.N.) Universal Declaration of Human Rights,  
and compliance with the law.

Although governments are primarily responsible for safeguarding 
human rights, we endeavor to conduct our business in a socially 
responsible and ethical manner consistent with human rights 
principles. Our approach to human rights is guided by international 
standards. We respect and support the U.N.’s Guiding Principles 
on Business and Human Rights, the Organisation for Economic 
Co-operation and Development’s Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises, the core Conventions of the International Labour 
Organization (ILO), the ILO’s Declaration on Fundamental Princi-
ples and Rights at Work, and the U.N.’s Universal Declaration of 
Human Rights.

Our American Airlines Human Rights Statement, which was 
formally approved by our Board of Directors in 2020, applies to all 
team members and contractors, employees of our wholly owned 
subsidiaries, and our suppliers and other business relationships. 
For many years, we addressed expectations about our commitment 
to human rights in our Standards of Business Conduct for 
team members and suppliers; in 2020 we strengthened those 
expectations by aligning them formally with global standards,  
such as the U.N.’s Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights. We continuously evaluate our operations and value  
chain to identify, assess and address human rights risks and  
to engage key stakeholders.

Our Statement complements our annual team member training  
on the Standards of Business Conduct. We also provide a  
dedicated 24/7 hotline for team members, suppliers and partners  
to anonymously report human rights concerns. We do not tolerate 
any retribution or retaliation taken against any individual who has,  
in good faith, sought advice or reported questionable behavior or  
a possible violation.

Our full Human Rights Statement can be found on our website.

Combating Human Trafficking
American is committed to combating human trafficking and child 
exploitation. As a prominent participant in the worldwide travel 
industry, we can help fight these terrible crimes.

Through training, we empower our team members to follow their 
instincts and take care of customers who may find themselves in 
unsafe or dangerous situations. We have mandatory human traf-
ficking awareness training for our frontline, customer-facing team 
members, including flight attendants, pilots and airport customer 
service representatives, as well as for team members with interna-
tional purchasing responsibilities. This training is required for new 
employees and as part of our recurrent training programs. We know 
that vigilance is key in fighting the scourge of human trafficking,  
and we stand ready to help.

Ending human trafficking requires a coordinated approach, and 
we seek partners to amplify our efforts. In January 2020, we joined 
the U.S. Department of Homeland Security’s Blue Campaign, a 
national public awareness effort that aims to educate the public, law 
enforcement and industry partners to recognize the indicators of 
human trafficking. We also are a signatory to ECPAT-USA’s Tourism 
Child-Protection Code of Conduct, a voluntary set of business 
principles to prevent child sex tourism and the trafficking of children. 

In 2020, we teamed up with New Friends New Life (NFNL), a Dallas-
based organization working to restore and empower formerly traf-
ficked teenage girls and sexually exploited women and their children. 
Texas ranks second in the country for trafficking prevalence, with 
more than 300,000 victims annually statewide.9 By providing access 
to education, job training, financial assistance, mental health and 
spiritual support, NFNL helps women and their children overcome 
backgrounds of abuse, addiction, poverty and limited opportunities. 
In the first months of the partnership, NFNL held training sessions for 
more than 100 American team members at our headquarters in Fort 
Worth, Texas, and another 120 at Miami International Airport. Our legal 
team is also providing pro bono services to NFNL, such as helping 
the organization’s clients expunge criminal records resulting from their 
time being trafficked.

In addition, American is a partner member of Texas Businesses Against 
Trafficking, a public–private awareness and prevention initiative led by 
the Texas Secretary of State.

Serving Our 
Customers

47

CEO Message Strategy Climate Safety Team Members TCFD/SASB DataCustomers



Providing our customers with exceptional service is crucial to our success. Our 
overarching goal is to provide a world-class customer experience, including safe 
and reliable service tailored to customers’ preferences. We constantly look for 
ways to improve our operations and the services we provide and seek feedback 
from our customers to understand how we can make our company even better.

W
e have made significant investments to enhance the 
customer experience, including rolling out new aircraft 
with enhanced amenities, increasing overhead bin 
space, boosting onboard Wi-Fi speed, upgrading airport 

lounges and improving communications. Many of these changes 
were in direct response to specific customer feedback. And, in 
response to the COVID-19 pandemic, we have taken other actions 
to help our customers feel safe and cared for when flying with us. 
(Learn more on p. 35.) 

While comfort and convenience are essential aspects of our service 
offerings, we know that dependability and reliability are what customers 
expect and care about the most. Our chief priority is getting passengers 
to their destinations safely, on schedule and with their baggage in 
tow, and we closely track our performance on these metrics. We also 
rigorously measure and track customer satisfaction through passenger 
surveys. In those surveys, we ask our customers about their likelihood 
to recommend American to others, which is driven by several critical 
factors: service delivery, check-in and boarding, onboard products and 
operational performance. 

Operational Performance
Our customers expect that we will get them to their destinations 
on time, with limited or minimal cancellations or disruptions. They 
also rightly expect their baggage to arrive with them. We track three 

related operational metrics to measure how well we are doing on 
these fronts: on-time performance, completion factor (i.e., percentage 
of flights arriving at their destinations without cancellations) and 
mishandled baggage. 

In 2019, our progress in improving operational performance was mixed. 
While we improved both on-time performance and completion factor in 

Our Goals

our regional operations, performance on those metrics in our mainline 
operations declined slightly. Beginning in 2019, the U.S. Department 
of Transportation developed a new way to measure the mishandled 
baggage rate (MBR), which made comparisons with prior years inap-
plicable. Looking at 2019 only, we saw our MBR increase in the second 
quarter after the Transport Workers Union–International Association of 
Machinists engaged in an illegal work slowdown to influence contract 
negotiations. The MBR started to slowly improve again in the third 
quarter, with continued improvement in subsequent quarters, as 
shown in the table at right. 

In parallel with our focus on improving operational performance 
in 2020 and beyond, we are working to provide more options for 
our customers when flight schedules are disrupted. We now give 
customers the ability to rebook delayed or cancelled flights on their 
mobile devices. (Customers previously had to call our reservations 
phone line to change a booking affected by a schedule change.) We 
also deliver digital meal and hotel vouchers to customers whose 
flights are disrupted, allowing them to electronically choose a hotel 
and redeem meal vouchers, also on their mobile devices. And we 
have improved our ability to keep customers and their checked bags 
together by expanding the use of baggage reconciliation tools to  
all of our ramp team members. Customer Satisfaction Surveys

We regularly survey our passengers to measure and improve the 
customer experience. Every month, approximately 180,000 travelers 
complete an electronic survey that asks questions about their experience 
with American on a specific segment of travel, including booking, check 
in, boarding, airline personnel and onboard comforts such as food, seats 
and connectivity. The surveys are sent to a random sampling of our cus-
tomers within 48 hours of a flight, with a five-day window for completion.

When we survey our customers, the first and most important question 
we ask is their Likelihood to Recommend (LTR), which measures a 
combination of satisfaction, customer loyalty and customer engage-
ment. We know that our LTR scores improve when customers are 
satisfied with the service they receive from our team members and with 

their check-in and boarding experiences. LTR also strongly correlates 
with on-time performance. Our customers want to depart and arrive as 
scheduled, and if a delay occurs, they want it handled well. 

Since we conducted our first online surveys in 1999, we have been 
using the responses to learn more about what customers want, where 
we are falling short and where we can improve. Typically, the biggest 
areas mentioned for improvement are the check-in and boarding 
processes. We’ve learned that customers enjoy the speed and flexi-
bility of checking in online, which is why we’re looking at more ways 
to streamline the check-in process for an improved experience. 

In 2020, we created a separate COVID-19 survey to understand what addi-
tional steps we could take to make our customers feel more comfortable  
with air travel. In response to survey feedback, we are offering more 
touchless experiences at the airport and are allowing customers to scan

is combined for mainline and regional domestic flights.

launched touchless kiosks for check-in, available to select U.S. travelers 
who scan their boarding passes at a kiosk to automatically print bag 
tags. Learn more about our response to the pandemic on p. 35.

Being Responsive to Customers
On a typical day, American receives approximately 4,500 customer 
comments, which range from frustrations with flight delays or fees to 
compliments for our team members.10 Our goal is to respond to the 
vast majority of these comments within 24 hours. 

Our customers share feedback with us through several channels, 
including our website, social media and emails, and we are currently 
testing a live chat function on our app. With live chat, our customer 
service agents are able to resolve most customer queries as they 
come in. For the other channels, we code each customer’s comment 
according to the concern they raise and assign responsibility for 
responding to one of our 12 specialty Customer Relations teams, 
each of which focuses on a particular type of service issue. These 
teams’ primary task is rebuilding customer trust. Coding also  
allows leadership to see trends across the company for feedback  
and coaching.

Before the COVID crisis, the most common service issue centered on 
delays and cancellations. We know that schedule changes that we handle 
well almost always result in fewer concerns raised by our customers.

We share reports of customer concerns quarterly with senior executives 
and our Board of Directors. Particularly strong comments regarding 
our service are shared verbatim with senior executives, and our Chief 
Customer Officer receives information about customer correspondence 
daily, including examples of how problems are resolved. 

While we take all issues raised by our customers seriously, we are 
especially focused on those that allege discriminatory behavior.  
In 2018, we created a special Customer Relations group to elevate 
sensitive discrimination complaints and to increase awareness 
among customer-facing team members of discriminatory behaviors. 
Each allegation is investigated, and disciplinary action, up to and 
including termination, will result if we determine that unacceptable 
behavior occurred. 

In 2019, as part of our implicit bias training program, this special 
Customer Relations group partnered with the Human Resources 
department to provide real-world examples of correspondence 
received from customers who complained about discriminatory 
behavior or treatment. We incorporated these examples into our 
training materials. (Learn more about our implicit bias training 
program on p. 40.) 

We aspire to learn from customer feedback to improve our processes 
for all passengers. For example, we have used customer comments to 
improve our services for unaccompanied minors, identifying specific 
seating zones where flight crews can better monitor unaccompanied 
youth during the duration of the flight. Customer comments also 
prompted us to change digital signage at gate check-ins to display 
upgrades by cabin and seat assignments.

Data Privacy
American’s privacy program, which is audited annually, is led by our 
Chief Privacy and Data Protection Officer and staffed with certified 
privacy professionals. We also have a Privacy Council, composed of 
more than 20 senior leaders who meet quarterly to discuss privacy 
issues, challenges and proposed solutions. The council is supported 
by approximately 75 privacy liaisons across the business.

Our Privacy Office regularly conducts privacy impact assessments 
of business processes and supporting information technology (IT)  

systems involved in processing personal data to identify and 
remediate associated privacy risks. Information obtained from  
these assessments is used to populate our personal data inventory 
detailing what personal data our company stores, how it is used, 
where it is stored, with whom it is shared and for how long it is 
retained. We supplement these efforts by coordinating with our 
IT department to implement privacy design requirements into the 
architecture and operation of our systems that store and process 
personal data. We also use these processes to fulfill our legal 
requirements for handling data rights requests and data disclosures 
via our internal and external privacy policies and statements.

customer complaints averaged around 3,000 per day.
