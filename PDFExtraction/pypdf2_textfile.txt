Approach
Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 contains long-term reduction targets for CO
2 emissions per unit of 50% by fiscal 2030 and 80% by fiscal 2050 (compared to fiscal 2010 levels) throughout 
Hitachi™s value chain.
The value chain for our products and services encompasses all stages from the procurement of 
raw materials and parts to production, transportation, use, disposal, and recycling. In May 2020 we 

announced an even more ambitious CO
2 reduction target of achieving carbon neutrality, which will 
mean net zero emissions, at our business sites (factories and offices) by fiscal 2030.
Approximately 90% of our value-chain emissions result from the use of our products and services 
after they are sold, and reducing these emissions will be crucial to reducing CO
2 emissions across 
the value chain. However, CO
2 emissions from the use of sold products and services are greatly 
influenced by changes in product sale price and business portfolios. We have established an 

indicator for providing products and services that produce less CO
2 from among products and 
services offering equivalent value, and, recognizing the importance of this matter, have set and 

continue to manage reductions goals for our main products and services on the basis of CO
2 emissions per unit. Specifically, by fiscal 2030, we aim to reduce CO
2 emissions per unit by 50% for products and services at the usage stage and contribute to reducing global CO
2 emissions through 
energy systems that do not emit CO
2 at the operational stage and expanding our new decarbonization business using digital technology such as OT and IT.
Additionally, in response to growing investor interest in the long-term impact of climate change on 
financial performance and corporate operations, we actively disclose climate-related information in 

accordance with the recommendations of the Task Force on Climate-related Financial Disclosures 

(TCFD) and also engage in dialogue with investors. Ratio of CO2 Emissions at Each Stage of Hitachi Value Chain in Fiscal 2019
Procurement of raw materials/parts 7.5%
Production 4.0%
Use 86.3%Transportation 0.1%
Disposal/recycling 0.4%
Other (capital goods, etc.) 1.7%GHG Emissions Throughout the Value Chain 
Objectives for CO2 Emissions per Unit from Products and 
Services in Use and Approach to Avoided Emissions
 Approach
To reduce CO
2 emissions from the use of our products and services, which make up the largest 
proportion of emissions in our value chain, we have established target reduction rates of CO
2 emissions per unit from products and services while in use. These rates are based on fiscal 2010. 

Given the unique qualities of the wide range of businesses we engage in, for each product or service 

subject to this initiative, we calculate the reduction rate of CO
2 emissions per unit with CO
2 emissions as the numerator and function size*1 as the denominator, and work toward overall reduction.
We also have high expectations for specific long-term CO
2 reduction countermeasures such as 
sales of renewable energy systems with zero emissions while in use and the use of technological 

innovation to replace existing products or services with new versions that provide the same value 

but emit less CO
2 while in use.The Guidelines on Calculating CO
2 Emission Reductions for Hitachi Group Products and 
Services*2 specify the following three methods for calculating different types of CO
2 emission reductions. Figures considered reductions for products and services while in use under the GHG 

Protocol, a global standard for CO
2 emission reduction disclosure, are calculated using method (1). 
Methods (2) and (3) are for avoided emissions.
(1)  Energy-saving feature enhancementsSet a reduction rate of CO
2 emissions per unit (compared to fiscal 2010) based on efficiency 
enhancements such as energy-saving feature enhancement in products and services. Every year, 
calculate reductions in CO
2 emissions considering the production volume of the relevant year. 
(2) Reduction through new systems and solutions based on technological innovationCalculate avoided emissions as reductions in CO
2 emissions due to the adoption of new systems and solutions that emit less CO2 while providing equivalent value to existing products, services, and solutions.
(3) Reduction through the deployment of non-fossil energy systemsCalculate avoided emissions as reductions in CO
2 emissions due to the introduction of 
renewable and other non-fossil energy systems, as compared to grid-supplied electricity (using 

the average emissions factor of the base year, fiscal 2010).
*1  Major functions of products correlated with CO
2 emissions.*2 The Guidelines are based on various standards, including the Guidance on Quantifying Greenhouse Gas Emission Reductions from the Baseline 
for Electrical and Electronic Products and Systems (IEC TR62726) issued by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC), and calculation 
methods established by the government or industrial associations.

AssuranceHitachi Sustainability Report 2020Contributing to a Decarbonized Society at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) 
CO2 Emission Reductions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices) 
and Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030 PolicyHitachi is working toward achieving its target of reducing CO
2 emissions from our business sites 
(factories and offices) by 50% compared to fiscal 2010 by fiscal 2030, as set out in Hitachi 
Environmental Innovation 2050, our long-term environmental targets.
To accelerate these efforts, in 2020 we announced an additional goal of realizing carbon neutrality 
by fiscal 2030 at all business sites (factories and offices). We call this goal ﬁHitachi Carbon Neutrality 

2030.ﬂUnder Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030, we aim to be carbon neutral by effectively reducing 
emissions by 100% by fiscal 2030 compared to fiscal 2010, instead of the original 50% reduction 

target. The following initiatives will help us achieve the new target.Major Initiatives for Reducing CO2 Emissions at Business Sites (Factories and Offices)Factories  Improve equipment efficiency by introducing and upgrading to high-efficiency equipment

  Promote investment in carbon-reduction equipment through adoption of the Hitachi Internal 

Carbon Pricing (HICP) framework*1 Credits assigned to energy certified as having been produced from renewable sources. Purchasers of such credits can offset their 
conventional energy use instead of implementing their own reduction measures.
Toward the goal of Hitachi Carbon Neutrality 2030, we have formulated a plan to make three 
existing factories in fiscal 2020 and a total of more than seven factories in fiscal 2021 carbon neutral. 
We believe that the technologies and experiences developed through efforts to achieve our carbon 

neutrality targets will help us offer business proposals accurately responding to our customers™ 

decarbonization needs, thereby greatly contributing to expanding our new business opportunities.
Introducing the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing Framework
 SystemTo promote CO
2 reduction at our business sites (factories and offices), in fiscal 2019 we started 
operating the Hitachi Internal Carbon Pricing*
1 (HICP) framework, which provides sites with 
incentives to invest in necessary new equipment.The HICP framework is an internal system that aims to achieve CO
2 reduction effectively. It helps 
visualize CO2 reduction from investment in equipment at factories and offices and encourage 
investment in new equipment that drives decarbonization through energy-saving and other 

measures as an extension of the established decision-making process on investment.
Specifically, with reference to emissions trading and carbon taxes globally, we establish 
company-internal carbon prices, convert into monetary value the effect of CO
2 reduction due to 
investment in equipment that contributes to decarbonization, add this to the value of energy 
reduction effects, and use the result to evaluate the effect of our investment. By applying incentives 

like these, we aim to further expand our investment in equipment that contributes to 
decarbonization.As the climate change issue deepens, we anticipate risks like increased burdens from carbon 
taxes and new emissions trading frameworks to emerge. By incorporating those risks into our 
equipment investment decisions, we can not only make investment in equipment that contributes to 

decarbonization a higher priority, but also minimize the future risks of climate change and make 

ourselves more resilient. The introduction of the HICP framework is a key part of this process.
Establishing and implementing the HICP framework resulted in additional investment in energy-

saving equipment. Such equipment did not receive investment before due to low returns, but it 

qualified under the HICP framework as it is expected to help reduce CO
2 emissions. Fiscal 2019 saw 35 cases of investment in energy-saving equipment with a total investment of ¥260 
million, contributing to an annual reduction of 1,356 tons of CO
2 emissions. The annual amount of CO
2 emission reductions from our business sites improved 2% compared to the previous 
fiscal year.

decarbonizationActions and Achievements Activities  302-1302-4305-4305-5At Hitachi, the achievement of environmental targets for individual business sites (factories and offices) set 
by the Environmental Action Plan for 2021 is measured by CO
2 emissions per unit. Because we conduct business in various sectors, the KPI of CO2 emissions per unit for each business site is calculated using the site™s CO
2 emissions as the numerator and its activity amount*1 as the denominator.
In fiscal 2019, the reduction rate of CO
2 emissions per unit was 5% against a target of 7% (compared to the base year of fiscal 2010). Part of the reason for not hitting the target was a lower 

efficiency of facility use due to a decrease in sales. There were also some business divisions that 

could not achieve expected reductions in CO
2 emissions per unit due to a failure to appropriately 
respond to a reduction in the fixed power allocation linked to sales.
We report the total CO
2 emissions from our entire Group, including CO
2 emissions from power 
plants selling electricity. Total CO
2 emissions in fiscal 2019 decreased by approximately 599 kt-CO
2 compared to fiscal 2018*
2 due to the sale of our power plants and a drop in sales. CO
2 emissions by region, excluding those from power plants, fell as a result of reorganization of business sites and a 

decline in sales in Japan. In the Americas, a materials company that became a reporting company in 

fiscal 2016 accounts for a large portion of CO2 emissions, and we will look into ways to promote the 
use of inexpensive renewable energies.

 Reducing Transportation Energy Consumption
 Activities As part of our efforts to reduce energy output during transportation as well as at our business sites 
(factories and offices), we have established targets for the reduction of transportation energy use per 

unit for each business unit and Group company in Japan. Outside Japan, these targets are voluntary. 

Our business sites are promoting a modal shift to highly efficient transportation methods, improving 

truck loading ratios and taking other measures to reduce transportation energy consumption, and 

switching to the use of eco-cars for in-house operation. Considering a modal shift from truck to rail 

transportation a high priority, we are working toward ﬁEco Rail Mark companyﬂ and ﬁEco Rail 

certified productﬂ certifications from the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism. 

Transitioning from truck to railway transportation is expected to reduce CO
2  emissions per unit to 
one-eleventh of its current level, and we plan to continue expanding our use of railways for long-

distance transportation.In fiscal 2019, CO2  emissions from transportation within Japan for the Hitachi Group were 88.4 
kt-CO2, 14.4 kt-CO2  less than the previous fiscal year. To reduce CO
2  emissions, we actively worked to improve efficiency when loading products for transportation and increase our use of 

coordinated transportation, reducing CO
2  emissions by more than 10% compared to fiscal 2018.
Achievements in FY 2019*1 Includes 1,070 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2016), 1,163 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2017), 1,112 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2018), and 950 kt-CO2 (fiscal 2019) emitted by 
a materials company that became a reporting company in fiscal 2016.
*2 Emissions from power plants selling electricity in Japan are included in the 
CO2 emissions data for fiscal 2017 and onward.
Notes:  Ł  Starting from fiscal 2019™s calculations, Scope 2 emissions were changed from a calculation method using a unified Group-wide 
electrical power conversion factor to a market-based calculation method, and past data was recalculated based on this. 

Regarding 
CO2 electrical power conversion factors: in Japan (including power plants), adjusted conversion factors for individual power businesses based on the Act on Promotion of Global Warming Countermeasures are used; overseas, the latest values 

for each fiscal year supplied by the International Energy Agency (IEA) as conversion factors for individual countries are used.
  Ł Energy-related 
CO2 emissions in fiscal 2019 were 1,489 kt-
CO2 (Scope 1) and 2,885 kt-CO2 (Scope 2).Introducing Renewable Energy
 Activities We are promoting the use of solar, wind, and other forms of renewable energy at our business sites. 
Going forward, we will accelerate these efforts, aiming to raise the share of renewable energy in our 

total electricity consumption to 2% by fiscal 2030.In fiscal 2019, Hitachi generated a total of 18,022 MWh of renewable energy for its own use, 

which is 2.6 times the amount generated in the previous fiscal year. Renewable energy 

generated by equipment installed at business sites (factories and offices) accounted for 0.3% of 

the electricity consumed by the entire Hitachi Group.

 Structure 
Hitachi sees climate change and other environmental issues as important management issues. A report 

to the Board of Directors in 2016 was followed by the establishment and announcement of long-

term environmental targets called Hitachi Environmental Innovation 2050 containing CO
2 reduction 
targets for fiscal 2030 and fiscal 2050.The Board of Directors discusses the Group™s sustainability strategy, including climate change 
measures, as a key component of management strategy. The Executive Sustainability Committee, 

chaired by the president and CEO and staffed by heads of corporate divisions and business units, 

meets twice a year to discuss and reach decisions on material environment-related policies and 

measures, including those in response to climate change, and to set the stage for implementation. 

In addition, the Audit Committee of independent directors conducts an audit of sustainability-

related operations once a year, and Hitachi executive officers report on climate-related material 

issues to the committee during the audit.As for activities outside the company, in 2019 an executive officer in charge participated in the 
TCFD Study Group on Implementing TCFD Recommendations for Mobilizing Green Finance 

Through Proactive Corporate Disclosures, launched by the Ministry of Economy, Trade, and 

Industry, and helped compile its report. Hitachi also participates in an industry-government-

academia initiative called the TCFD ConsortiumŠcomprising 164 companies and other 
organizationsŠas a member of its Steering Committee and contributed to the formulation of TCFD Guidance 2.0, announced in July 2020.Strategy Policy 102-11102-15102-29201-2We are responding to climate change by fulfilling our responsibilities as a global company in 
achieving a decarbonized society. Taking note of the total CO
2 reductions required globally under the 
RCP 2.6*1 and RCP 8.5*2 scenarios of the Fifth Assessment Report of the Intergovernmental Panel 
on Climate Change (IPCC), we have established long-term environmental targets called Hitachi 

Environmental Innovation 2050 based on our Environmental Vision calling for CO
2 reductions 
throughout our value chain of 50% by fiscal 2030 and 80% by fiscal 2050, compared to fiscal 2010.
In May 2020 we announced an even more ambitious CO

Identification and Assessment of Climate-related Risks and Opportunities
 The Hitachi Group operates a broad array of businesses around the world, with each business 

having its own set of risks and opportunities. We are responding to the impact of climate change by 

assessing climate-related risks and opportunities in accordance with TCFD classifications. We make 

sector-specific assessments of risks and opportunities for important business sectors that have a 

relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate change. Our assessments are also categorized 

according to time span, namely, short term, medium term, and long term, as defined below.

AssuranceHitachi Sustainability Report 2020Climate-related Risks
 As for climate-related business risks, we have followed the TCFD™s classification in considering 
(1) risks related to the transition to a low-carbon economy in the 2°C scenario and (2) risks related 

to the physical impacts of climate change in the 4°C scenario, which assumes that efforts to reduce 

global CO2 emissions have failed.Climate-related Opportunities
 CO2 emissions during the use of our products and services by our customers account for 
approximately 90% of total emissions in our value chain. To achieve the CO
2 reduction targets set 
forth in our long-term environmental targets and 2021 Mid-term Management Plan, Management 

Plan, it is essential that we reduce emissions during use. Developing and providing products and 

services that emit zero or very little CO
2 during their use will not only satisfy customer needs but also help meet society™s demands for reduced emissions. This represents a business opportunity for 

us in the short, medium, and long term and constitutes a major pillar of the Social Innovation 
Business that we are promoting as a management strategy.

environment and 
major risks and 
opportunities under 
the 2°C scenarioBusiness environment:
 Global demand for 
transport systems that emit less CO2 per 
distance covered will grow with tighter 
CO2 emission regulations in each country and 

region
Business environment:
 Global demand for 

electricity generated from renewable energy, 

nuclear power, and other non-fossil sources 

will grow with tighter 
CO2 emission 
regulations in each country and region. 

Power networks will increasingly 

accommodate natural energy produced 

through distributed generation.
Business environment:
 Demand for 

energy-saving, high-efficiency IT solutions 

will grow with tighter 
CO2 emission 
regulations in each country and region. 

There will also be a jump in demand for data 

centers and data analysis systems to 

accommodate the expansion of such 

financial services as investments and loans 

for decarbonization businesses and green 

bond issues, as well as of data utilization 

businesses.Business environment:
 Global demand for 

energy-saving industrial equipment will grow 

with tighter CO2 emission regulations in 
each country and region
Business environment:
 Electric vehicles 

will rapidly spread with tighter laws and 

regulations on fuel efficiency and 

environmental standards, and increases in 

fossil fuel prices. Markets for alternative, 

non-fossil technologies like hydrogen and 

biofuel vehicles will expand. The number of 

countries and regions with near zero sales 

of internal combustion engine vehicles will 

increase.
Business environment:
 Demand for 

electric and low/no carbon-fuel construction 

machinery will grow with tighter laws and 

regulations on the use of fossil fuels. 

Environmental regulations for items other 

than CO2 emissions (air and noise pollution, 
etc.) will grow tighter in urban areas.
Risks: Competitiveness will decline if there 

are delays in the development of innovative 

emission-reducing technologies, including 

those to improve the efficiency of railway 

services through digital utilization, such as 

dynamic headway (flexible operation in 

response to passenger demand)  as well as 

new mobility services like MaaSRisks: Delays in the construction of power 

networks enabling the mass introduction of 

renewable energy with large output 

fluctuationsRisks: Competitiveness will decline if there 

are delays in the development of 

technologies and human capital to offer 

energy-saving, high-efficiency IT solutions; 

shortages in human capital; and slow 

implementation of decarbonization 

measures for energy-consuming data 

centersRisks: Competitiveness will decline if there 

are delays in the development of high-

efficiency, low-loss products
Risks: Failure to transition to a new 

business environment of rapidly declining 

sales of internal combustion engine vehicles
Risks: Higher development costs, lost 

markets due to slow response, and higher 

costs in building customer support for the 

use of electric and low/no carbon fuel 

machinery. Loss of customers due to the 

short range of electric machinery and lack 

of fueling and power-storage infrastructure 

for low/no carbon fuel machinery. Declining 

demand due to divestment of major coal 

companies.Opportunities:  Demand will grow for 

railways, which emit less CO2 per distance 
covered. There will be a shift to energy-

saving railcars from conventional models, 

and the efficiency of railway services will be 

improved through digital utilization. Data 

usage will also boost demand for new 

mobility services.Opportunities: Business opportunities will 

grow with rising demand for renewable 

energyŠthe key to a decarbonized futureŠ

and with the provision of grid solutions, 

digital service solutions, and energy 

platforms that can accommodate the 

diversification of energy suppliersOpportunities: Demand will grow for 

energy-saving and high-efficiency 

information systems that contribute to 

zero-emissions. There will also be increased 

demand for platforms to offer such 

environment-related financial services as 

investments and loans for decarbonization 

businesses and green bond issues.
Opportunities: Utilization of IoT, 

digitalization, and connected systems to 

develop innovative products and solutions 

that contribute to CO2 emission reductions 
without relying on the energy-saving 

features of individual products
Opportunities: Markets for alternative, 

non-fossil technologies like electric, 

hydrogen, and biofuel vehicles will expand
Opportunities: Sales and sale opportunities 

for electric machinery, a broader diversity of 

fuel types, and digital applications will 

increase as companies turn to new 

technologies and adapt to new site 

environments
The business 
environment and 
major risks and 
opportunities under 
the 4°C scenarioBusiness environment:
 Demand for 

electric-powered transport will gradually 

increase even without tighter energy 

regulations. Damage from typhoons, floods, 

and other natural disasters caused by 

climate change will rise sharply.
Business environment:
 The cost 

competitiveness of non-fossil energy will 

increase, and demand for renewable, 

nuclear, and other non-fossil energy will 

increase as the expansion of energy 

consumption pushes up the price of fossil 

fuels. Natural disasters caused by climate 

change will rise sharply.
Business environment:
 Demand for new, 

high-efficiency technology will expand as 

multiplex IT systems in response to natural 

disaster BCPs will result in increased energy 

consumption. Demand will also grow for 

social and public systems to reduce 

damage from natural disasters.
Business environment:
 Typhoons, floods, 

and other natural disasters caused by 

climate change will rise sharplyBusiness environment:
 Fuel efficiency laws 

and regulations will remain lax globally, and 

internal combustion engine vehicles will 

remain a major mode of transport. The 

modal shift will be slow, as conventional 

automobiles and motorcycles will remain 

predominant. Typhoons, floods, and other 

natural disasters caused by climate change 

will rise sharply.
Business environment:
 Natural disasters 

caused by climate change will rise sharply, 

boosting demand for construction 

machinery to support speedy and safe 

recovery efforts
Responding to Climate Scenario Risks and Opportunities for Each Business Hitachi operates a broad array of businesses, with each business having its own set of risks and 
opportunities. We therefore selected businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being 

affected by climate change and examined the business impact of and responses to the 2°C and 4°C 

scenarios. Under the former, our assessments were premised on there being stronger measures and 

regulations for decarbonization envisioned by the IPCC™s RCP 2.6 scenario. By assuming somewhat 

tighter regulations and an earlier target date for CO
2 reductions, we can prepare ourselves for the 
1.5°C scenario. Under the latter, we focused on there being increased climate-induced natural 

disasters as a result of lax regulations, as projected by the RCP 8.5 scenario.
In selecting the businesses that have a relatively high likelihood of being affected by climate 
change, we took many different factors into account and chose those with (1) relatively high CO
2 emissions from the use of products and services, (2) a relatively high need for fossil fuels during the 

use of products and services, and (3) high sales volume within the Group. The businesses we 

selected using these criteria were railway systems, power generation and power grids, IT systems, 

industrial equipment, automotive systems, and construction machinery. Our assessment of the major 

climate-related risks and opportunities for these businesses are outlined in the following table:

Risks: Natural disasters will exacerbate 
damage to production facilities, worsen 

working environments, and disrupt supply 

chains, leading to delays in deliveries and 

the procurement of parts
Opportunities: Transport systems more 
resilient to natural disasters can be developed. 

Competitiveness can be enhanced by providing 

added value in such forms as energy-saving 

railcars and adaptability to new technologies.Opportunities: Energy demand will grow as 
warmer weather leads to increased use of 

air conditioning. Demand will increase for 

disaster-resilient power generation and 

transmission/distribution technologies.Opportunities: Demand will increase for 
social and public systems that help reduce 

damage from natural disasters and for IT 

systems required as part of a BCP
Opportunities: Efforts to accommodate IoT 
products will lead to higher demand for 

remote control and remote maintenance 

during natural disastersOpportunities: Demand will grow for 
technologies to enhance the efficiency of 

internal combustion engines
Opportunities: Infrastructure projects to 
prevent and mitigate disasters and support 

recovery efforts will increase
Non-environmental 
market factors (neither the 2°C nor 4°C scenario)  Economic growth will lead to urbanization 

and population growth around the world, 

driving the railway business globally as an 

efficient form of public transport for large 

numbers of passengers, regardless of 

climate conditions. Market size in Japan 

will remain flat, but the Asian market 

overall will see substantial growth.
 Long-distance transport will decline going 

forward as the global pandemic restricts 

travel and encourages remote work. The 

decline in demand, though, will not be as 

severe as that for air transport.
 Competition will grow as major railway 

manufacturers in various countries will 

expand their business to meet global 

demand Economic growth, urbanization, and 

population growth will push up demand for 

energy, especially electricity, mainly in 

developing countries Energy supply and demand will diversify 

due to various factors, such as CO2 emissions, environmental burden, 

economic performance, safety, and supply 

stability Digital technology will be further applied to 

enhance the stability and efficiency of the 

power supply Further digitization globally will 

exponentially increase the volume of data 

circulated, accumulated, and analyzed. 

Experience with the global pandemic will 

prompt a shift to remote, noncontact, and 

online formats, both in our life and work, 

and boost demand for solutions that 

facilitate such a shift. New services and businesses utilizing big 

data, IoT, AI, and other digital technology 

will expand rapidly Digitalization, infrastructure renewal, 

population decline, and worker shortages 

will expand the automation market in 

industrial countries As the global pandemic forces people to 

stay at or work from home, demand will 

grow for factory automation enabling a 

handful of workers to operate a factory The industrial market in emerging 

economies will grow due to a rise in 

production plants
 Economic growth, urbanization, population 

growth, and infrastructure development 

like road construction will expand the 

global market for automobiles as a flexible 

and personal means of transport The global pandemic may temporarily 

dampen passenger vehicle sales due to 

restrictions on people™s movement, but 

commercial vehicle sales appear to be 

rising as need for goods delivery increases
 Non-environmental functions like 

autonomous driving and advanced safety 

features that promote safety, security, and 

comfort will drive competitiveness Worker shortages will be addressed through 

further labor savings, automation, remote 

work, and the development of safety-related 

products and solutions
 Products, services, and solutions (such as 
CO2-free machines/attachments suited for 
work at dismantling sites, in narrow spaces, 

and underground) will be further developed 

to meet the needs of smart infrastructure 

building amid rapid urbanization Emerging economies with expanding 

markets represent both increased sale 

opportunities and intensifying competition 

with emerging manufacturers
 There is a need for stronger total supply 

chain management to accommodate 

shifting demand and for enhanced 

resilience of the business portfolio
Responses to future 
business risks (business opportunities)Response to business risks under 2°C or 
4°C scenario

AssuranceHitachi Sustainability Report 2020Risk Management Structure 
The Hitachi Group evaluates and monitors climate-related risks for each business unit and Group 
company as part of a process of assessing risks and opportunities in accordance with the 

Environmental Action Plan, updated every three years. The results are tabulated by the 

Sustainability Promotion Division of Hitachi, Ltd., and their importance is checked at Sustainability 

Promotion Meetings. Those risks and opportunities perceived as being particularly important for the 

Group as a whole are deliberated by the Executive Sustainability Committee, chaired by the 

president and CEO of Hitachi, Ltd. 
Metrics and Targets
 GoalsOur environmental activities are managed through the Environmental Action Plan, whose metrics and 

targets are updated every three years, including those to measure and manage climate-related risks 

and opportunities.We use the reduction rate of CO
2 emissions per unit compared to fiscal 2010 to set targets and 
monitor progress across our many Group products and services in the value chain. Under the current 

Environmental Action Plan for 2021 (covering fiscal 2019Œ2021) as well, we have established annual 

targets and monitor progress for each business unit and Group company.
Total greenhouse gas emissions (Scope 1, Scope 2, and Scope 3) across our value chain are 
calculated based on GHG Protocol standards, and we have published annual figures since fiscal 

2012. Given the nature of our business, some 90% of our total CO
2 emissions come from the use of 
sold products in Scope 3. CO
2 emissions can fluctuate greatly, though, due to changes in sales 
volume and our business portfolio. To advance CO
2 reductions during the use of sold products and 
services, therefore, we set targets and monitor progress for the reduction rate of CO
2 emissions per unit. In other words, for products and services featuring equivalent value, we focus on metrics to 

provide customers and society with those that emit less CO
2. At the same time, we will make an exerted effort to not only reduce per unit but also total CO
2 emissions from our business sites 
(factories and offices).
